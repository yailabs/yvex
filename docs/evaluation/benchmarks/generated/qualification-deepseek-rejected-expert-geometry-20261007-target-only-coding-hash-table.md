## Runtime populations and speculative work

Counters come from terminal runtime facts. Missing counters are not zero.
Channel totals may exclude control delimiters; phase spans are not assumed additive.

No confidence interval is inferred from small sample counts. The machine receipt retains samples, prompt/reference identities and provenance.

## Non-claims

- Timing is bound to one exact checkpoint/artifact/backend/device/configuration; no 20/700 gate or quality claim.
- This is a controlled public-C host consumed over native v25, not the installed Rust/chat product or HTTP adapter.
- Fresh sessions and exact uncached input counts; 16-token prefill controls do not publish sustained decode.
- Load is N=1 with uncontrolled file/cache state; it cannot qualify cold load latency or a residency speedup.
- Server first committed token and client-visible content are separate clocks; first fragment publication remains unavailable.
- Checkpoint/reference quality and successful high/maximum transitions are not qualified by non-thinking captures.
- Sampled clear lists cannot prove uninterrupted reservation. Raw observations remain independently reopenable.
- Fixed-format/block-count Tensor Core expert specialization is neutral across the complete-model coding and 2K/8K prefill tradeoff; remove the extra instantiations, retaining the independently checked generic numerical path.
