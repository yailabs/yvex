# External Reference-Engineering Baseline

**Current procedure or lookup, linked to its technical owners.**

[Up](README.md)

This document owns the pinned external sources used to pressure or check YVEX
architecture and implementation. It does not import external capability,
project state, or release claims. Current YVEX ownership is documented in the
[implemented system](../architecture/README.md).

This record maps primary papers, specifications, and implementation
references to YVEX owners. It does not own project state, milestone state,
dependency order, capability claims, or Active Next; those belong only to
[Status](../project-control/STATUS.md).

References identify proven decomposition, exact model behavior, container
rules, numerical contracts, and independent comparison points. YVEX still owns
its C API, process model, memory lifetime, failure behavior, tests, and support
claims.

## Ownership rules

- Prefer the original paper, format specification, official documentation, or
  direct implementation source over summaries and blog posts.
- Record the exact upstream revision when a milestone turns a reference into
  executable behavior or a golden comparison.
- Translate concepts through the owning YVEX type or module; do not reproduce a
  Python class hierarchy as C file structure.
- External support, output, artifacts, and benchmarks do not prove YVEX
  support.
- Conflicting sources are blockers until the exact local model source and a
  validated implementation contract resolve them.

## Validation boundary

### Pinned DeepSeek-V4 architecture baseline

`V010.MODEL.ARCH.IR.0` interprets the exact model snapshot at
`60d8d70770c6776ff598c94bb586a859a38244f1` against DeepSeek-V4 paper
`arXiv:2606.19348v1`, SGLang commit
`96a04cb13f9c3ed86028e090784a9eb059cf5318`, and vLLM commit
`8df14cfc8c8a09b4e57f082e59593a3abce4ffb3`. The source snapshot is the
identity/config authority; the paper and runtimes resolve architecture
semantics and independent topology expectations. The canonical YVEX result is
the immutable owner under `src/model/families/`, not an inherited Python class
hierarchy or external support claim.

The current source rebase consumes the DSpark snapshot at
`62af8fffb2f7030cac4de2f0169f5b8d1101b646`. Its configuration and tensor
inventory are authoritative for payload identity and geometry. DSpark paper
`arXiv:2607.05147v1`, the bundled inference code, DeepSpec commit
`005e03b81cec38b7da6399833d609ee89a2587f2`, and vLLM DSpark commit
`d9dac2b3d4cdd57ff2f7c5311bc8aaf3eef3feec` resolve proposal, verification,
acceptance, and commit semantics. The official vLLM recipe uses greedy draft
sampling with standard target rejection sampling; the distinct optional block
verification method is not DSpark's default semantic contract. In particular,
the public configuration's
single next-token prediction declaration is not treated as the draft depth:
the bundled inference configuration and tensor geometry establish three draft
stages conditioned by target features from layers 40, 41, and 42.

`V010.GRAPH.DEEPSEEK.ATTENTION.0` resolves the executable attention boundary
against those same pinned sources and runtime-numeric authority commit
`e7706faf8d1c3b9f241e36860640ad1dac644ede`. The local source and pinned
runtime implementations establish base RoPE without YaRN for SWA, the
compressed-class YaRN policy for CSA/HCA, and HCA admission of a complete
non-overlapping group when its end position becomes available at the exact
ratio 128. The paper remains semantic context; it does not override the exact
executable source transition or transfer external support into YVEX.

`V010.RUNTIME.1` consumes those semantics through a typed DeepSeek adapter and
one family-neutral runtime model/session. vLLM and SGLang inform the separation
between immutable model resources, mutable request state and phase-aware
execution; YVEX does not inherit their worker topology, scheduler, Python API or
KV layout. CUDA Graph execution follows the Driver API lifecycle directly and
captures YVEX production kernels from the existing generated bundle. The
semantic graph, lowered executable graph, CUDA launch graph and instantiated
graph executable retain separate identities.

### Pinned GGUF qtype storage baseline

`V010.GGUF.QTYPE.ABI.1` uses ggml commit
`af97976c7810cdabb1863172f31c432dab767de7`. At that revision the GGUF
specification defines the on-disk type range through ID 39. The implementation
also defines `NVFP4`, `Q1_0`, and `Q2_0` as IDs 40 through 42. YVEX records
those identities and their upstream geometry but refuses them as outside the
pinned on-disk baseline.

`include/yvex/qtype.h` and `src/gguf/qtype.c` own the admitted identity and
geometry. Storage uses `ne[0]` as row width, requires exact block division, and
multiplies row bytes by the checked product of the remaining dimensions. Dtype,
parser, range, integrity, conversion, and memory-plan owners consume that
registry. Storage admission remains independent from reference dequantization,
quantization, emission, and backend compute.

Each consuming milestone must record which upstream revision and local source
facts it used, the YVEX owner that implements the result, the independent test
or comparison, and any unresolved divergence. A reference becomes evidence
only through that milestone's executable tests. Until then it is design input.
