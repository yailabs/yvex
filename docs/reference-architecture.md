# YVEX Reference Architecture Map

Date: 2026-07-14
Status: external reference ownership contract
Authority: primary papers, specifications, and implementation references mapped
to YVEX owners

This document owns the external engineering baseline. It does not own project
state, milestone state, dependency order, capability claims, or Active Next;
those belong only to `../PROJECT.md`.

References are used to identify proven decomposition, exact model behavior,
container rules, numerical contracts, and independent comparison points. YVEX
still owns its C API, process model, memory lifetime, failure behavior, tests,
and support claims.

## Ownership Rules

- Prefer the original paper, format specification, official documentation, or
  direct implementation source over summaries and blog posts.
- Record the exact upstream revision when a milestone turns a reference into
  executable behavior or a golden comparison.
- Translate concepts through the owning YVEX type or module; do not reproduce a
  Python class hierarchy as C file structure.
- External support, output, artifacts, and benchmarks do not prove YVEX
  support.
- Conflicting sources are blockers until the exact local model source and a
  validated implementation contract resolve them.

## Validation Boundary

### Pinned DeepSeek-V4 Architecture Baseline

`V010.MODEL.ARCH.IR.0` interprets the exact model snapshot at
`60d8d70770c6776ff598c94bb586a859a38244f1` against DeepSeek-V4 paper
`arXiv:2606.19348v1`, SGLang commit
`96a04cb13f9c3ed86028e090784a9eb059cf5318`, and vLLM commit
`8df14cfc8c8a09b4e57f082e59593a3abce4ffb3`. The source snapshot is the
identity/config authority; the paper and runtimes resolve architecture
semantics and independent topology expectations. The canonical YVEX result is
the immutable owner under `src/model/families/`, not an inherited Python
class hierarchy or external support claim.

### Pinned GGUF Qtype Storage Baseline

`V010.GGUF.QTYPE.ABI.1` uses ggml commit
`af97976c7810cdabb1863172f31c432dab767de7`. At that revision the GGUF
specification defines the on-disk type range through ID 39. The implementation
also defines `NVFP4`, `Q1_0`, and `Q2_0` as IDs 40 through 42. YVEX records
those identities and their upstream geometry but refuses them as outside the
pinned on-disk baseline.

`include/yvex/qtype.h` and `src/gguf/qtype.c` own the admitted
identity and geometry. Storage uses `ne[0]` as row width, requires exact block
division, and multiplies row bytes by the checked product of the remaining
dimensions. Dtype, parser, range, integrity, conversion, and memory-plan owners
consume that registry. Storage admission remains independent from reference
dequantization, quantization, emission, and backend compute.

Each consuming milestone must record which upstream revision and local source
facts it used, the YVEX owner that implements the result, the independent test
or comparison, and any unresolved divergence. A reference becomes evidence only
through that milestone's executable tests. Until then it is design input.
