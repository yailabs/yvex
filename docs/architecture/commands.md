# Command and operation architecture

Status: current implemented architecture

YVEX is one inference/compiler/runtime product with four distinct process
roles: finite offline work, one persistent hosted runtime, native local
clients, and external compatibility clients. Command spelling never changes a
process role according to TTY state, loaded engines, or host presence.

## Domain objects

| Object | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| Model | logical semantic identity shared by related representations |
| Source | acquired payload, exact revision, provenance, and verification state |
| Artifact | immutable compiled physical package |
| Profile | durable deployment configuration naming an artifact, backend, and admitted runtime policy |
| Engine | process-local loaded engine generation owned by the host |
| Session | mutable conversation/generation state bound to one exact engine generation |
| Host | foreground process owning engines, sessions, scheduling, execution, listeners, and logs |

These names are not aliases. In particular, a profile is not a loaded engine.
They are exact plumbing authorities, but they are not peer concepts in the
ordinary product workflow. The porcelain `model` projection joins them only by
authenticated lineage and presents one logical model with its source and
representation variants. Similar display names never create lineage.

## Product grammar and plumbing

```text
yvex
yvex help [COMMAND...]
yvex help --advanced
yvex help --json
yvex version

yvex serve
yvex chat [--model MODEL]

yvex host status|logs|stop
yvex inspect ...

yvex model search|pull|prepare|load|unload|list|show|active|push
yvex model status|stop
```

The memorable lifecycle is:

```text
search -> pull -> prepare -> load -> chat
                    push -> outward distribution
```

`pull` and `push` move or reference representations. `load` and `unload`
change runtime residency. Those meanings never overlap. Exact engineering
plumbing remains available through `help --advanced`:

```text
yvex source ...
yvex artifact ...
yvex profile ...
yvex engine ...
yvex session ...
yvex compile ...
yvex bench ...
```

Provider account plumbing is registry-addressable as `source accounts
providers|status|whoami|login|logout|ensure`. These are distinct operations,
not opaque arguments passed through one generic command row. Human tables and
redacted JSON share the same account observations; credential ownership stays
with the installed provider CLI.

Bare `yvex` prints the compact command map and exits successfully. It never
starts, attaches to, or probes a host and never enters chat. Interactive human
generation requires `yvex chat`. Programmatic generation uses the private
typed protocol through native clients or the admitted loopback provider API;
there is no public one-shot generation command.

The old `run`, `server`, `execute`, `profile`-as-a-verb, and implementation
top-level namespaces are not aliases. Obvious retired spellings fail with a
bounded migration hint and never dispatch their former operation.

## Process roles

### Foreground host

`yvex serve` always attempts to become the persistent foreground host. It owns
the private Unix socket, engine manager, scheduler, sessions, backend
execution, telemetry, and optional loopback OpenAI listener. A one-time TTY
boot report is followed by an ordinary line-oriented host log stream. The
process does not read an administrative command language from stdin, own the
alternate screen, clear scrollback, or become a client.

If a healthy host already owns the socket, `yvex serve` refuses and identifies
the socket and inspection command. It never attaches to that host. Native
administration is performed from another process with `host`, `engine`, and
`session` commands.

### Native chat client

`yvex chat` is the sole public REPL. It requires a TTY and connects to the
private local protocol. It opens no artifacts, initializes no CUDA state,
starts no host, and loads no engine. A missing host produces the explicit
`yvex serve` remediation; a missing engine points to `yvex model load`.

The linear editor is the externally linked REPLAI ABI 1 implementation. It owns
grapheme editing, history navigation, paste, resize/redraw and exact terminal
restoration. YVEX supplies prompt values, history admission, registry completion
and interrupt meaning. During generation the editor is closed; YVEX owns output
and protocol cancellation. See [the dependency decision](../decisions/0007-external-terminal-editor.md)
for the exact pin, build requirements and lifecycle evidence. Registry-derived
slash operations remain limited to conversation and session use:

```text
/help /status /context
/new /sessions /session /use /detach /reset /cancel /close
/attach /attachments /attachments-clear
/think-low /think /think-max /nothink
/quit
```

Reasoning policy persists for the attached session until changed. The client
does not describe it as a next-turn-only setting. Load, unload, compile,
acquire, and host-stop operations are deliberately absent from the REPL.
`/attach PATH` seals one local media object for the next turn; repeated calls
stage multiple ordered parts. `/attachments` lists that bounded stage and
`/attachments-clear` discards it. Submission appends the typed text part,
clears the stage after server acceptance, and retains the same session identity
for later multipart turns. `/use NAME` selects an existing session; attachment
staging never creates or replaces one.

### Hosted model use and exact administration

`host` addresses the already-running process. Porcelain `model load` accepts a
logical model selector and resolves only its proven launchable
representations. With no model on a TTY it renders a small linear model
selector; if that model has several valid deployments it renders a second
variant selector. Numeric rows are temporary conveniences. Before the native
request, the CLI has resolved one exact profile identity; the host then creates
an immutable process-local engine generation. Non-TTY ambiguity fails and
requires `MODEL` and `--variant` rather than guessing.
Each launchable profile also carries the same directional input/output
capability summary later published by its engine, so an orchestrator can select
a READY deployment before demand activation without inferring from its name.

`model unload MODEL` resolves the resident exact generation and drains it
without stopping the host. Advanced `engine load PROFILE` and `engine unload
ENGINE` remain deterministic plumbing for qualification and exact lifecycle
inspection, but ordinary users never need a profile alias. Session commands
address server-owned mutable state and cross the same private protocol. None of
these clients opens a package directly.

`model active` projects loaded engine generations from the same typed engine
catalog used by `engine list`: backend, execution mode, active/idle state,
attached sessions/clients, model leases, directional capabilities, and H12
resource/placement facts. Its JSON schema is `yvex.model.active.v1`; consumers
never parse the human table.

### Offline work

`model search` discovers without downloading. `model pull` parses one
deterministic source locator, pins remote provider identity before acquisition,
and delegates to source ownership. Local pull explicitly chooses a managed copy
or verified external reference. `model prepare` delegates verification,
compilation, artifact emission, and deployment creation to their existing
owners; it does not manufacture support when a family lacks a full-package
binding. `model push` exports one exact chosen representation and never means
runtime loading.

Source commands inspect exact provenance, artifact commands inspect immutable
compiled packages, and profile commands inspect deployment configuration.
Specialized compiler phases remain discoverable below `compile`. Bounded
component execution and measurement live under `bench`; read-only engineering
evidence lives under `inspect`. Offline commands neither require nor start a
host.

## Protocol planes

Native commands and chat use private local protocol v21 over a UID-owned Unix
socket. That protocol carries YVEX engine generations, sessions, KV identity,
lifecycle, ordered typed content/provenance, model leases and directional
capabilities, typed progress, cancellation, resource facts, and telemetry.

External compatibility consumers use the separate loopback HTTP OpenAI
profile. The adapter owns no model, engine, session, KV, scheduler, or backend
state and never parses CLI output. Native clients do not route through HTTP.

## Canonical operation authority

`config/operator/registry.json` is the strict `yvex.operator.registry.v1`
operation authority. The build
validates it and emits immutable descriptors plus a content identity. Those
descriptors drive parsing, dispatch, human help, JSON discovery, shell
completion, and the chat slash catalog. Domain owners retain capability,
semantic validation, and typed result authority; the registry does not create
support by naming an operation.

Default help projects only the product map. `help --advanced` exposes admitted
advanced and engineering leaves. `help --json` is a stable structured
projection with exact operation and command identities. Human and machine
renderers consume the same typed result and machine output contains no ANSI.
Registry-generated shell completion applies the same projection at an empty
top-level position: only `chat`, `help`, `host`, `inspect`, `model`, `serve`,
and `version` are suggested. Advanced roots remain executable and regain their
full registry-driven subcommand completion after the user explicitly types the
root.

## Output and errors

Product results go to stdout and product errors to stderr. Human views respect
TTY detection and `NO_COLOR`; redirected and structured output is
non-decorative. Submission-time errors surface immediately. Host/backend
failures are returned through the correct typed completion boundary rather
than being inferred from log prose.

The foreground host is the logging producer. `yvex host logs` projects its
typed stream from another process; `--json` selects the machine JSONL
projection and `--follow` makes continuous intent explicit. No second logging
authority or administrative REPL exists.

## Non-claims

This local product architecture does not establish public HTTP serving,
authentication, TLS, remote security, full OpenAI compatibility, distributed
serving, model quality, benchmark authority, or release qualification.
