# Implemented YVEX System

Status: current implemented architecture

This document owns the implemented process topology and subsystem boundaries.
It explains the current system; it does not own project state, command syntax,
or release claims.

## System boundary

YVEX is one native compiler and inference system with one product executable:

```text
yvex  foreground model server, protocol clients, and finite offline operations
```

`libyvex` supplies reusable compilation, artifact, runtime, graph, backend,
tokenizer, and generation owners. It is not a process or a separate public
command surface.

![Source/compiler owners and local product consumers converge on one persistent host, with generation-bound engines and session state above CPU/CUDA execution.](../diagrams/system_overview.svg)

*Figure 1 — System context and ownership. The loopback HTTP adapter belongs to
the persistent host, while CLI and external applications remain clients.
Observation is downstream of execution; no remote-service, continuous-batching
or release-readiness claim follows from this topology.*
[Editable source](../diagrams/system_overview.json).

## Product processes

`yvex` has three mechanically separated lanes:

- the runtime-client lane uses the private local protocol for chat,
  runtime administration, sessions, live model inspection,
  cancellation, and the single human/JSON log surface;
- the foreground `serve` lane owns the persistent multi-engine host and its
  independently loaded engine generations;
- the finite offline-engine lane calls admitted library owners for compilation,
  artifact operations, inspection, direct component execution, profiling, and
  system facts.

The runtime-client lane cannot open an artifact, initialize CUDA, execute a
Transformer, or host a model. The offline lane closes all resources before the
process exits and never owns persistent sessions. The server lane is explicit
in the invocation and never shells out to or executes a hidden binary.

The foreground server lane owns one private Unix listener, one loopback
OpenAI-compatible listener, one telemetry authority, and a bounded set of
engine generations. Each loaded engine owns its immutable runtime model,
scheduler, sessions, state, and resources. HTTP and native clients bind work to
an exact alias and generation rather than a process-global model pointer.

## Subsystem direction

The implemented dependency direction is:

```text
core and public ABI
  -> source, GGUF, artifact, model, tokenizer
  -> compilation and graph planning
  -> materialization and runtime
  -> backend execution
  -> generation
  -> evaluation and benchmark

domain facts -> typed results/events -> client render -> client I/O
```

Source owners establish provenance, retained tensor inventories, bounded
payload access, and trust. Compilation owners derive artifact-neutral
transformations and physical policy. GGUF and artifact owners serialize,
parse, authenticate, and admit complete artifacts. Runtime owners import the
binding, prepare immutable model resources, and isolate mutable execution
sessions. Graph and backend owners execute already-admitted operations; they do
not reconstruct model topology.

The product levels are verified source, logical model, family projection,
Transformation IR, quantization decisions, physical variant, Physical
Execution IR, complete artifact, admission, materialization, runtime binding,
deployment specialization, model-engine generation, mutable session, executable
batch, request transaction, workload evidence, benchmark, and release
qualification. These levels are identities and lifecycle boundaries, not
aliases for directories.

## Authority boundaries

| Boundary | Current owner |
| --- | --- |
| Source provenance, inventory, payload trust | `src/source/` |
| Remote provider discovery and remote representation records | `src/accounts/`, `src/model/remote.c`, `include/yvex/catalog.h` |
| Local acquired-source and admitted-package catalogs | `src/model/catalog.c`, `src/model/artifacts/`, `include/yvex/catalog.h` |
| Family source facts, coverage and logical lowering | `src/model/families/` |
| Artifact-neutral transformation and physical policy | `src/model/compilation/`, model compilation owners |
| GGUF container, qtypes, writer, layout | `src/gguf/` |
| Artifact snapshot, integrity, admission, and bounded artifact ranges | `src/artifact/` |
| Backend-owned weight materialization | `src/model/materialization.c`, `include/yvex/materialization.h` |
| Semantic/executable graph and state protocols | `src/graph/` |
| Runtime binding, model engines, specialization, sessions, residency, scheduler | `src/runtime/` |
| Device capability, memory, kernels, launch graphs | `src/backend/` |
| Autoregressive composition | `src/runtime/generation.c` and typed generation owners |
| Persistent host, live engine observation, routing, protocol, telemetry | `src/server/` |
| OpenAI-compatible projection | `src/server/openai/` and `src/provider/` |
| Command metadata and projections | `config/operator/registry.json`, generated descriptors, `src/cli/` |

Family source interpretation and graph recipes occupy separate compilation
levels, described by [family integration](../model-families/integration.md).
Generic runtime and backend owners consume typed plans, not family-name
switches. The current pure-SSM decoder gap remains an explicit admission
barrier rather than an alternate runtime.

The exact source-file ownership manifest is
[`config/source_owners.tsv`](../../config/source_owners.tsv). It is also the
sole handwritten production build-membership list; a checked deterministic
projection supplies Make product classes. Contributor-facing layout and build
ownership rules are in
[Source and Module Ownership](../development/source-ownership.md).

## Application surfaces

The [private local protocol](../contracts/local-protocol.md) carries typed
host/engine lifecycle, exact generation routing, multipart content, leases,
streamed channels, status, progress, and refusals. Incompatible versions are
rejected before fixed-layout records are interpreted.
The in-process OpenAI adapter translates the bounded compatibility profile to
the same protocol/session semantics. Neither transport enters graph, tokenizer,
sampling, or model APIs directly.

The command registry is validated at build time and compiled into `yvex` as
immutable descriptors. It owns operation IDs and projection metadata, not
domain behavior. Human help, JSON discovery, completion, dispatch syntax, and
REPL slash schemas consume that one authority.

## Interactive terminal path

![REPLAI edits inside the chat client; YVEX builds typed requests, binds sessions, controls generation and renders server-authored results.](../diagrams/interactive_boundary.svg)

*Figure 5 — Interactive ownership. Submission returns UTF-8 after editor
restoration; the YVEX adapter constructs typed content and request semantics.
Panels (a) and (b) live in the same chat process: REPLAI is a statically linked
dependency, not another process or model runtime.
The figure shows the continuing path, not a concurrent editor during generation.*
[Editable source](../diagrams/interactive_boundary.json).

[ADR 0007](../decisions/0007-external-terminal-editor.md) owns the editor split
and [`config/replai.json`](../../config/replai.json) owns its exact pin. YVEX
retains prompt values, history admission, slash-completion decisions, reconnect,
attachments and semantic rendering. Ctrl-C while editing is a generic REPLAI
event; during generation it enters YVEX cancellation and quiet-output handling.
EOF, exit and transport failure follow their distinct close/recovery paths.
Historical `repl_` helper names do not establish another editor.

The private `src/cli/io/terminal/` contract exposes terminal observation,
opaque output/capture scopes and interrupt counts, not descriptors, signals or
console layouts. The current POSIX implementation adapts the editor entrypoint,
captures interrupts, and joins its watch before application context expires.
The client callback decides which generation to cancel; terminal capture never
owns engine/session meaning. Output-state admission and restoration failures
stop chat instead of continuing with uncertain terminal state.

This is an interface portability boundary, not cross-platform qualification.
Linux PTY tests exercise the implementation and the pinned REPLAI ABI, which
now has Linux/macOS POSIX qualification. YVEX itself remains Linux-qualified;
a macOS or Windows port must qualify its
platform adapter, editor dependency and local transport; neither a POSIX signal
nor a Windows console event is a generic request type.

[Real chat PTY tests](../../tests/repl_pty.sh), their
[consumer assertions](../../tests/replai_consumer.py), and the
[tiny runtime vertical](../../tests/integration/tiny_vertical.sh) qualify the
composition. The classical REPL decomposition is explained in the
[external guide](https://github.com/mothx9/replai/blob/master/docs/repl.md);
its default branch does not change the pinned dependency.

## Current implementation scope

The [family boundary table](../model-families/integration.md#current-family-boundaries)
distinguishes DeepSeek and Qwen text execution, MiniMax composite media
execution, and Mamba2's source/component-only boundary. Their shared owners
do not make their evidence stages interchangeable.

The [runtime architecture](runtime.md) owns generation, selection,
transactional state, and measurement. Admitted CUDA selection can retain
resident logits while tokenizer, RNG coordination, protocol, and orchestration
remain host-owned. There is no all-on-device, quality, release benchmark, or
release-qualification implication. [ROADMAP](../../ROADMAP.md) owns those gates.
