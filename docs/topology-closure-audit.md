# Topology Closure Audit

Date: 2026-07-08

Base inventory commit: `d41439c refactor: remove model target runner`

The base inventory and every follow-up below are point-in-time evidence. Each
follow-up names the commit whose paths and counts it records; no path, count,
or "remaining" statement in this document is a current-tree ownership claim.

## Scope

This audit covers the repository after the source, generation, KV, sampling,
graph, and model-target cell extraction rows. It checks ownership drift between
CLI input, command adapters, domain/report builders, renderers, explicit file
writers, runtime/core modules, and `libyvex.a`.

This is an audit-only artifact. It does not change command behavior, implement
runtime capability, implement quantization, emit artifacts, or close global
topology.

Conclusion: `closure-blocked-by-major-residue`

## Direct Output Inventory

Command:

```sh
git grep -nE '\b(printf|fprintf|vprintf|vfprintf|puts|fputs|fputc|putchar|perror|fwrite)\s*\(' -- src include || true
```

Classification:

| Class | Count | Status |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| allowed CLI IO | 3 | allowed |
| allowed explicit file writers | 14 | allowed |
| allowed model-target sidecar writer | 30 | allowed explicit local file writer |
| outside final writer owners | 4350 | legacy pending / violation for closure |

Largest outside-writer files:

| Path | Matches | Classification |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `src/model/artifacts/` | 2558 | major legacy pending |
| `src/runtime/core.c` | 432 | major legacy pending |
| `src/artifact/core.c` | 365 | major legacy pending |
| `src/gguf/tools.c` | 286 | major legacy pending |
| `src/accounts/provider.c` | 100 | legacy pending |
| `src/gguf/quant_plan.c` | 85 | legacy pending |
| `src/core/fs.c` | 75 | legacy pending |
| `d41439c:src/runtime/chat.c` | 70 | legacy pending |
| `d41439c:src/generation/decode.c` | 69 | legacy pending |
| `d41439c:src/generation/logits.c` | 64 | legacy pending |
| `src/backend/core.c` | 45 | legacy pending |
| `src/tokenizer/core.c` | 42 | legacy pending |
| `d41439c:src/metrics/core.c` | 41 | legacy pending |
| `src/source/write.c` | 26 | explicit source writer candidate; needs owner review |
| `d41439c:src/graph/report.c` | 1 | graph dump compatibility residue |

## CLI-Shaped Input Inventory

Command:

```sh
git grep -nE '\b(argc|argv)\b|usage:|--help|--output|--audit' -- src include || true
```

Classification:

| Class | Count | Status |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| total matches | 678 | audit surface |
| outside CLI input/commands/router/catalog | 147 | legacy pending / needs cleanup |

Top non-CLI owners:

| Path | Matches | Classification |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `src/model/artifacts/` | 34 | major legacy pending |
| `src/gguf/tools.c` | 21 | legacy pending |
| `src/runtime/core.c` | 19 | legacy pending |
| `src/artifact/core.c` | 19 | legacy pending |
| `src/tokenizer/core.c` | 9 | legacy pending |
| `src/backend/core.c` | 6 | legacy pending |
| `d41439c:src/generation/logits.c` | 3 | legacy pending |
| `d41439c:src/generation/decode.c` | 3 | legacy pending |

Some model-target report modules contain output-contract field values such as
`--output` in row text or test-facing strings; those are not CLI parsers, but
they should be reviewed when CLOSURE.2 turns advisory findings into hard guards.

## CLI/Operator Include Inventory

Command:

```sh
git grep -nE '#include "yvex_(cli|operator|console)|#include <.*cli.*>' -- src include || true
```

Non-CLI/core hits:

| Path | Count | Classification |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `src/model/artifacts/` | 2 | major legacy pending |
| `src/accounts/provider.c` | 1 | legacy pending |
| `src/artifact/core.c` | 1 | legacy pending |
| `src/backend/core.c` | 1 | legacy pending |
| `d41439c:src/generation/decode.c` | 1 | legacy pending |
| `d41439c:src/generation/logits.c` | 1 | legacy pending |
| `d41439c:src/generation/prefill.c` | 1 | legacy pending |
| `src/gguf/tools.c` | 1 | legacy pending |
| `d41439c:src/runtime/chat.c` | 1 | legacy pending |
| `src/runtime/core.c` | 1 | legacy pending |
| `src/tokenizer/core.c` | 1 | legacy pending |

## Renderer Leakage Inventory

Command:

```sh
git grep -nE 'yvex_backend|yvex_graph_build|yvex_model_ref|native_weight|safetensors|fopen|open\(|read\(|write\(' -- src/cli/render || true
```

Result: 34 matches, all in `src/cli/render/source.c`.

Classification: advisory false positives. The matches are typed source report
fields and literal output labels containing `safetensors`; no renderer file IO,
backend open, graph construction, or report building was found by this scan.

## Command Adapter Inventory

Threshold: 350 lines.

| Adapter | Lines | Status |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `src/cli/commands/source.c` | 221 | pass |
| `d41439c:src/cli/commands/kv.c` | 156 | pass |
| `src/cli/commands/graph.c` | 129 | pass |
| `d41439c:src/cli/commands/sampling.c` | 115 | pass |
| `src/cli/commands/model_target.c` | 112 | pass |
| `d41439c:src/cli/commands/generate.c` | 87 | pass |

All remaining command adapters are 18-line forwarding adapters.

## Report Text-Buffer Inventory

Command:

```sh
git grep -nE 'primary_text|diagnostic_text|raw_output|report_text|captured_text|line_buffer|capture|sink' -- src include || true
```

Findings:

| Path | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| `src/accounts/provider.c` | provider subprocess capture; legacy pending, not report blob |
| `include/yvex/core.h` | log/status sink wording; allowed text description |
| `d41439c:src/generation/kv_report.c` | comment wording only |

No model-target `primary_text`, `diagnostic_text`, `raw_output`,
`report_text`, `captured_text`, or `line_buffer` debt remains.

## Compatibility Shell Inventory

Command:

```sh
git grep -nE 'compat|legacy|shim|bridge|runner|not-bound|renderer-only|_render_boundary|boundary anchor' -- src include || true
```

Important findings:

| Path | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| `d41439c:src/graph/report.c` | graph dump compatibility; pending cleanup |
| `src/cli/render/private.h` | render boundary helper; pending CLI renderer cleanup |
| `src/cli/render/private.h` | legacy operator render helper; pending cleanup |
| `src/accounts/provider.c` | legacy provider binary discovery; likely real behavior |
| `src/runtime/core.c` | direct conversion bridge output; pending cleanup |
| `include/yvex/gguf.h`, `include/yvex/model.h` | public bridge terminology; not automatically invalid |
| `src/model/target/*` | semantic compatibility/status field values only; no runner/backend shell |

## Monolith Inventory

Thresholds:

- warning: over 1000 lines
- strong warning: over 2500 lines
- critical: over 5000 lines

| Path | Lines | Severity | Mixes layers |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `src/model/artifacts/` | 17223 | critical | yes; next row should split model artifacts/control-plane output |
| `src/runtime/core.c` | 4698 | strong | yes; runtime CLI/report/output residue remains |
| `src/runtime/graph.c` | 4538 | strong | likely primitive proof density; needs focused review |
| `src/gguf/quant_plan.c` | 2513 | strong | likely policy/tooling mix; needs focused review |
| `src/gguf/tools.c` | 2184 | warning | command surface/tooling mix remains |
| `src/backend/core.c` | 2103 | warning | backend report/output residue remains |
| `src/artifact/core.c` | 1995 | warning | artifact command/report/output residue remains |
| `src/gguf/conversion.c` | 1678 | warning | conversion bridge/map facts need review |
| `src/source/report.c` | 1466 | warning | source report is large but cell-owned |
| `src/backend/cuda/ops.c` | 1352 | warning | CUDA primitive implementation density likely justified |
| `src/model/core.c` | 1297 | warning | model registry/materialization facts need review |
| `src/accounts/provider.c` | 1247 | warning | provider execution/capture mix remains |
| `src/core/fs.c` | 1217 | warning | filesystem utility/output residue needs review |
| `d41439c:src/generation/core.c` | 1169 | warning | closed cell but still large enough to monitor |
| `src/tokenizer/core.c` | 1158 | warning | tokenizer command/report residue remains |
| `src/artifact/integrity.c` | 1037 | warning | integrity report/output residue likely |
| `src/gguf/core.c` | 1007 | warning | parser density likely acceptable pending review |

Recommended next row should start with the critical `src/model/artifacts/`
residue, not quantization implementation.

## libyvex Leakage Inventory

Command:

```sh
grep -nE 'src/cli/(input|commands|render|io)' Makefile || true
```

Result: Makefile references CLI sources only in CLI source variables and include
paths. `CORE_SRCS` does not include `src/cli/input`, `src/cli/commands`,
`src/cli/render`, or `src/cli/io`.

`libyvex.a` CLI leakage: 0.

## Project Alignment

This audit remains the point-in-time inventory of control-plane/domain
ownership residue. It is not a product progress map. Its historical topology
row IDs are supporting architecture evidence in `PROJECT.md`, not primary
release tracks. Current state and consuming milestones are owned only by that
project ledger; these findings do not advance artifact or runtime gates.

## Retained Cleanup Findings

| Row | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `TOPOLOGY.CELL.CLOSURE.2` | remove or hard-classify the residual direct-output and CLI-shaped domain debt found here |
| `TOPOLOGY.CELL.MODEL_ARTIFACTS.0` | split `src/model/artifacts/` into domain/report/input/command/render/write ownership |
| `TOPOLOGY.CELL.RUNTIME.0` | split runtime report/command/output residue from runtime coordination |
| `TOPOLOGY.CELL.ARTIFACT.0` | extract artifact inspect/integrity command and rendering surfaces |
| `TOPOLOGY.CELL.GGUF_TOOLS.0` | split GGUF command/tool output from GGUF parsing/conversion/quant internals |
| `TOPOLOGY.CELL.BACKEND.0` | split backend reports/rendering from backend abstraction |
| `TOPOLOGY.CELL.TOKENIZER.0` | split tokenizer command/report/render ownership |
| `TOPOLOGY.CELL.GRAPH.COMPAT.0` | remove FILE-based graph dump compatibility or move it to an explicit writer |

## Explicit Conclusion

`closure-blocked-by-major-residue`

The completed cell extractions removed the model-target runner debt and the
major source/generation/KV/sampling/graph/model-target mixed-cell surfaces, but
global topology closure is still blocked. The highest-risk residue is direct
operator output and CLI-shaped command/report ownership in `src/model`,
`src/runtime`, `src/artifact`, `src/gguf`, `src/backend`, `src/tokenizer`, and
provider/account modules. `PROJECT.md` owns when each finding is removed or
absorbed; this audit does not set Active Next.

## Follow-up: TOPOLOGY.CELL.MODEL_ARTIFACTS.0

Evidence commit: `c3c0bd7c96c1a20bf6a993efdb34980e64e11633`.

Previous `c3c0bd7c:src/model/yvex_model_artifacts.c` direct-output count: 2558.
New `c3c0bd7c:src/model/yvex_model_artifacts.c` direct-output count: 0.

Previous `c3c0bd7c:src/model/yvex_model_artifacts.c` line count: 17223.
New `c3c0bd7c:src/model/yvex_model_artifacts.c` line count: 28.

CLI include status: cleared from `c3c0bd7c:src/model/yvex_model_artifacts.c` and
`src/model/artifacts/*`; command-surface includes now live under
`c3c0bd7c:src/cli/commands/yvex_model_artifacts_cli.c`.

CLI-shaped input status: cleared from `c3c0bd7c:src/model/yvex_model_artifacts.c`,
`src/model/artifacts/*`, and the model-artifacts renderer. CLI-shaped parsing
residue now lives under CLI command/input ownership.

Remaining residue: the historical `models`, `fullmodel`, `attention`,
`context`, `moe`, and `tensor-collection` command bodies were moved out of the
model domain to preserve command compatibility, but they still need a later
focused command/input/render decomposition. This follow-up closes the critical
model-domain monolith and direct-output pressure, not global topology closure.

Next recommended row: split the moved model-artifacts command surface into
thin command adapters and typed render/report modules, or continue with the next
largest audit residue after rerunning the closure audit.

## Follow-up: TOPOLOGY.CELL.MODEL_ARTIFACTS.1

Evidence commit: `9a812f8ab8b7799ce2a83b705a839766ff676edb`.

Previous `9a812f8a:src/cli/commands/yvex_model_artifacts_cli.c` line count: 14723.
New `9a812f8a:src/cli/commands/yvex_model_artifacts_cli.c` line count: 142.

Parsing ownership: public command symbols now route through the model-artifacts
input/report/render contract and a CLI-only transitional surface. Full lexical
parsing for the historical `models`, `fullmodel`, `attention`, `context`,
`moe`, and `tensor-collection` surfaces still needs a later typed migration.

Rendering ownership: the public command adapter no longer owns field, table, or
JSON helper functions. Historical rendering remains in
`9a812f8a:src/cli/model_artifacts/yvex_model_artifacts_surface.c`, not in the domain or
`libyvex.a`.

Remaining model-artifacts command residue:
`9a812f8a:src/cli/model_artifacts/yvex_model_artifacts_surface.c` is still a large
transitional CLI surface at 14724 lines. It preserves current command behavior
while the adapter is locked down; it is not global closure.

Direct output status: no new model-artifacts domain output sites were added.

CLI-shaped input status: model-artifacts domain/render remain free of raw
`argc`/`argv`; raw command vectors remain only in CLI-owned files.

Next recommended row: decompose
`9a812f8a:src/cli/model_artifacts/yvex_model_artifacts_surface.c` by surface into typed
input/report/render ownership, starting with `models download` and
`fullmodel`.

## Follow-up: TOPOLOGY.CELL.MODEL_ARTIFACTS.2

Evidence commit: `8f5cda58d24cf159bcf3e86e87b7d59fe316f12b`.

Previous `8f5cda58:src/cli/model_artifacts/yvex_model_artifacts_surface.c` line count:
14724.

Final root surface status: deleted.

Final root surface line count: 0.

New command-family surface files:
`yvex_models_surface.c`, `yvex_models_download_surface.c`,
`yvex_models_download_write_surface.c`,
`yvex_models_download_process_surface.c`,
`yvex_models_download_control_surface.c`,
`yvex_models_prepare_surface.c`,
`yvex_models_artifacts_surface.c`, `yvex_fullmodel_surface.c`,
`yvex_fullmodel_report_surface.c`, `yvex_fullmodel_materialize_surface.c`,
`yvex_attention_surface.c`, `yvex_context_surface.c`, `yvex_moe_surface.c`,
and `yvex_tensor_collection_surface.c`.

Largest remaining `src/cli/model_artifacts/*.c` file:
`8f5cda58:src/cli/model_artifacts/yvex_models_prepare_surface.c` at 1838 lines.

No `src/cli/model_artifacts/*.c` file is over 2500 lines.

Remaining surface residue: command-family files are still CLI-only transitional
surfaces and contain legacy parsing/output for compatibility. The debt is now
bounded by command family instead of concentrated in one historical 14k-line
surface. Later cleanup can migrate each family into stricter typed
input/report/render ownership without re-opening the domain boundary.

Next recommended row: rerun the closure audit and select the next largest
remaining residue, or continue with a focused typed-renderer cleanup for the
largest model-artifacts command family.

## Follow-up: TOPOLOGY.CELL.MODEL_ARTIFACTS.3

Evidence commit: `5794b6b5866793d98849527ad4669b1e858c4394`.

Previous direct output/formatting matches in `src/cli/model_artifacts`: 3326.

Final direct output/formatting matches in `src/cli/model_artifacts/*.c`: 0.

Previous parser-residue matches in `src/cli/model_artifacts`: 235.

Final parser-residue matches in `src/cli/model_artifacts/*.c`: 0.

New render files: `yvex_models_render.c`,
`yvex_models_artifacts_render.c`, `yvex_models_download_render.c`,
`yvex_models_download_control_render.c`,
`yvex_models_download_process_render.c`,
`yvex_models_download_write_render.c`, `yvex_models_prepare_render.c`,
`yvex_fullmodel_render.c`, `yvex_fullmodel_report_render.c`,
`yvex_fullmodel_materialize_render.c`, `yvex_attention_render.c`,
`yvex_context_render.c`, `yvex_moe_render.c`,
`yvex_tensor_collection_render.c`, and
`yvex_model_artifacts_render_common.c`.

Largest remaining surface file:
`5794b6b5:src/cli/model_artifacts/yvex_model_artifacts_surface_common.c` at 21 lines.

Largest new render file:
`5794b6b5:src/cli/render/yvex_models_prepare_render.c` at 1837 lines.

Remaining exceptions: the new render files still preserve historical command
logic as compatibility rendering code. The surface-routing boundary is closed,
but a later row should migrate the render owners from legacy command-shaped
facts to typed model-artifacts report facts.

Next recommended row: decompose model-artifacts render owners into typed
report/render APIs, starting with `models prepare/check` because it is the
largest remaining render file.
