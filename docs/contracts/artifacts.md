# Artifact and Admission Contract

Status: normative implemented contract

Authority: artifact terminology, complete-artifact admission, repository
payload policy, and the boundary between artifact, materialization, runtime,
and release support. Producers are compilation/GGUF owners; consumers are
artifact admission, materialization, runtime binding, and operator inspection.

Complete and supported artifacts are external operator assets. They are
never committed to this repository. The repository may contain only tiny GGUF
fixtures under `tests/`.

## Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Tensor proof artifact | A file containing one tensor or a bounded tensor subset, used only to prove a named parser, range, materialization, primitive, or reference property. |
| Complete artifact | A file containing every tensor and metadata item required to execute one exact logical model. |
| Supported artifact | A complete artifact that passes integrity, materialization, runtime, generation, evaluation, benchmark, and release-qualification gates for its declared scope. |

The unqualified term "model artifact" does not refer to a selected-tensor proof
file. A structurally valid GGUF is not necessarily complete or supported.

Tensor byte accounting consumes the canonical row-aware GGUF qtype owner.
Block-quantized shapes require `ne[0]` to divide exactly by the block width;
flattened element-count alignment and partial-row padding are not admitted.
Known storage geometry does not imply a decoder, quantizer, emitter, compute
kernel, complete artifact, or supported artifact.

The logical model is independent of this artifact contract. An immutable
Transformation IR describes exact logical source-to-terminal derivation. The
current quant plan/physical variant selects one parameter representation under
explicit policy, calibration and backend-compute feasibility; it is not a live
deployment optimizer. An artifact serializes one such variant; GGUF is the
v0.1.0 release lowering, not the identity of the logical model. Admission proves
the emitted package and its lineage; it does not decide which representation
should exist.

A versioned Physical Execution IR (PEIR) is a downstream package projection,
not an artifact mutation or a deployment plan. PEIR v5 binds each authenticated
terminal tensor and physical-variant identity to its canonical role and
coordinates, qtype, row geometry, encoded range, alignment, consumer, stable
package layout, sharing class, and terminal identity. It contains no live
backend, device, activation, kernel, placement, fallback, or residency choice.

Deployment specialization later combines those package facts with one real
backend and device. Backend-owned executable materialization may create derived
packed resources inside that deployment lifetime. Such resources are not PEIR
or canonical artifact bytes unless separately published and authenticated as a
package asset; they are never trusted by path.

Current DeepSeek physical variants and their admitted evidence are recorded in
the [family technical record](../model-families/deepseek-v4-flash.md).
Version-specific release requirements belong to the
[v0.1 readiness contract](../releases/v0.1.md). Neither record changes this
general admission contract.

## Source Payload Handoff

The canonical source payload session is construction input, not an artifact.
It consumes one exact verifier result and its retained header snapshot, binds
each source tensor to a securely admitted shard and checked absolute byte
range, and delivers deterministic bounded chunks through a transactional sink.
It neither reparses source headers nor retains whole tensors.

For the pinned DeepSeek source, authoritative Hugging Face Git LFS SHA-256
values establish `upstream_payload_verified` only after every complete shard
digest matches. If an equivalent provider has no authoritative payload digest,
the distinct `local_payload_snapshot_sealed` class may identify the local byte
snapshot but may not claim upstream verification. The ordered aggregate
payload identity and per-shard trust facts are published atomically in the
canonical source manifest outside the repository.

The canonical operator projection is `yvex source verify --source DIR
--models-root DIR --source-manifest FILE`. It is finite, reads every shard on
first publication, refuses missing provider SHA-256 authority, and never
materializes or hosts a model. Reopening an unchanged upstream-verified v3
manifest reuses its identity without rereading the payload; any source or
provenance drift fails closed.

This handoff makes exact source bytes available to a later transformation
executor. It does not define transformation semantics, perform datatype
conversion or expert aggregation, select qtypes, quantize, encode GGUF, emit a
complete artifact, materialize tensors, or execute a runtime.

## Native Structural Reader

The canonical native reader parses GGUF v3 container, metadata, and tensor
directory records through bounded positioned reads. Its immutable parsed view
owns decoded strings, arrays, tensor facts, and lookup indexes. Structural
inspection neither maps nor copies the complete artifact and reads zero tensor
payload bytes.

Parser budgets bound hostile counts and declared strings or arrays while
admitting the known DeepSeek-scale directory. Duplicate identifiers, malformed
records, refused qtypes, arithmetic failures, and short reads produce typed
non-success results. Typed human, machine, and integrity projections consume
that operational result; building a report cannot convert a rejection into an
accepted artifact.

The canonical global layout validator consumes the immutable reader view and
same opened artifact snapshot. It requires nonzero power-of-two alignment, the
first tensor at relative offset zero, exact directory-order padded
continuation, zero directory/tensor padding, an exact aggregate data span, and
no trailing bytes. It reads only padding intervals and reports zero tensor
payload bytes read. Typed layout acceptance is a container property, not a
complete-artifact or supported-artifact claim.

## Admission Contract

A complete artifact must record or prove:

- exact source and target identity;
- architecture and tokenizer metadata;
- every required global, layer, attention, position, KV, MoE, expert, norm, and
  output-head tensor role;
- every declared draft feature, stage, Markov, confidence, verification, and
  shared-resource role when speculative capability is advertised;
- exact qtype, shape, layout, offset, alignment, range, and byte accounting;
- deterministic writer output and writer-reader equivalence;
- artifact identity and corruption refusal;
- materialization and runtime descriptor compatibility.
- complete Physical Execution IR coverage for every terminal consumer.

For `deepseek4-v4-flash-dspark`, one complete artifact contains the 43-layer
target and all DSpark draft requirements. Metadata records the five-position
block, noise token, ordered target feature layers, three draft stages,
rank-256 Markov geometry, confidence availability, sharing, and target
verification requirement. A target-only artifact or binding must not advertise
DSpark. Missing draft tensors, scale companions, qtype support, workspace, or
verification plans refuse admission instead of selecting target-only mode.

A supported artifact additionally requires the runtime, generation,
evaluation, benchmark, and release gates in
[Release Doctrine](../releases/doctrine.md).

## Verified Reopen

Complete byte authentication may publish a rebuildable local verified-reopen
receipt. The receipt binds the expected artifact identity to one stable
filesystem snapshot and records that full byte verification previously
completed. A later open may skip the full payload hash only when both identities
still match. Structural GGUF, tensor, qtype, catalog, role, and family admission
remain mandatory.

Composite runtimes consume the same artifact-owned mechanism independently for
each component. Missing, stale, malformed, or unreadable receipt state falls
back to full byte verification. A successful fallback safely repairs the
receipt; a byte mismatch fails closed and publishes no trusted evidence. One
component fallback does not invalidate unrelated warm component hits. The
cache root is deployment/runtime policy, never family semantics, and verified
reopen is not materialization or residency evidence.

## Existing Proof Files

Legacy selected DeepSeek files and aliases may still exist outside the
repository while their owning decommission rows are pending. They are tensor
proof artifacts only. Their digest, range, materialization, or primitive
evidence must be named by the specific proof and must not be promoted to model
support.

This contract does not retain an artifact card or historical validation
catalogue for those files. Their retired chronology is recoverable from Git.

## Repository Guardrail

```sh
git ls-files '*.safetensors' '*.bin' '*.dat'
git ls-files '*.gguf'
```

Expected result:

- no tracked safetensors, bin, or dat model payloads;
- tracked GGUF files are tiny test fixtures only;
- no local registries, reports, source downloads, emitted artifacts, logs, or
  generated backend outputs are tracked.

## Non-Claims

This contract does not claim that any complete artifact is a supported
artifact, nor does it claim a selected release profile, model behavior or
quality evaluation, a release-path full-model benchmark, or release readiness.
