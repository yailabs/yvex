# Events and Telemetry Contract

Status: normative implemented contract

Authority: server/runtime typed event owners and telemetry fan-out. Renderers
project these facts but do not own event meaning.

## Producer and consumers

Runtime, server, session, generation, listener, and shutdown owners publish one
ordered event stream. Consumers are the server raw console, local protocol
subscribers, status/metrics accumulation, `host logs`, and the interactive
console.

No consumer scrapes another renderer's text.

Operational events, execution metrics, audit evidence, and profiler output are
separate classes. An operational event contains only lifecycle facts known at
publication; it does not fill future counters with candidate capacity.
Execution accounting may aggregate work without becoming audit evidence, and
full probes never enter normal watch merely because trace verbosity increased.

## Event identity

Each event carries a schema, global sequence, wall and monotonic timestamps,
severity, kind, process/runtime identities, and applicable model, engine
generation, artifact, specialization, session, request, turn, phase, counter,
timing, rate, and result fields. Content is excluded unless an explicit
trace-content policy admits it.
The sealed semantic identity binds sequence, kind, correlations, counters,
durations, result facts, and model identities. Process ID and observed wall or
monotonic clock values remain diagnostic fields and do not enter that identity.

Events observe state after the owning publication boundary. An event cannot
make an uncommitted state visible or promote capability.

## Lifecycle coverage

Typed events cover at least:

- host startup/readiness, engine load, package/binding admission,
  specialization, materialization, residency, draining, unload, and failure;
- listener preparation/readiness/failure;
- client/session attach and lifecycle;
- request admission, queueing, tokenization, prefix reuse, and prefill;
- draft start/completion, target verification start/completion, accepted prefix,
  candidate rejection, and speculative-cycle commit;
- first token, decode progress, fragment publication, commit, and stop;
- media request, conditioning, latent iteration, video/audio decode,
  publication, completion, cancellation, and failure;
- cancellation, refusal, failure, and partial progress;
- memory/resource counters and bounded profile stages;
- host shutdown admission, engine drain/close, and completion.

## Fan-out and overflow

One bounded fan-out distributes the event to raw JSONL, protocol subscribers,
metrics, and human renderers. Low-priority progress may be coalesced or dropped
under pressure, and overflow remains an explicit fact. Lifecycle and terminal
events receive retention priority over replaceable progress. Once the ring is
full, a new progress record replaces the oldest replaceable record; it cannot
evict a retained lifecycle or terminal record while any replaceable slot
exists. If every retained record is non-replaceable, incoming progress is
coalesced instead of displacing it. One retained `telemetry.dropped` record is
updated with exact aggregate pressure/coalescing counts rather than appending a
warning for every loss. Ring storage remains fixed and drop accounting cannot
amplify event pressure.

Subscription failure or a slow client cannot block scheduler workers
indefinitely. Disconnect releases subscriber resources without closing an
engine or the host.

## Projections

`yvex serve` renders the compact human projection in the owning foreground
terminal by default. `yvex host logs` renders a finite retained-history
snapshot from another terminal, while `host logs --follow` keeps the typed
subscription open. `host logs --verbose` additionally renders individual
speculative cycles. `yvex serve --logs json` and `yvex host logs --json`
emit canonical JSONL for the admitted trace schema. `host status` is a
bounded host snapshot and `engine list` is the engine-inventory snapshot;
neither is an event replay. Human projections render retained history plus live
events in stable semantic categories. They retain operator-significant host,
engine, session, contended queue, prefill, first-token, aggregate speculative
economics, completion, cancellation, and failure events while suppressing
native internal connection churn, uncontended queue admission, fragments, intermediate
draft/verification steps, and profile rows. They render bytes in human units,
speculative acceptance as
accepted/proposed, and stop codes as their named contract values. The `--json`
projection retains the full selected event sequence with sequence, severity,
turn, phase, timing, and rate. Human rows name each counter's meaning; raw JSONL
retains the versioned event fields and their phase-specific interpretation. Native prefill
progress sent to the REPL is another projection of the sealed event, not a
synthetic client event.

Text generation publishes a generic rolling `generation.progress` event after
the first committed token at most once per second or each 64 committed tokens.
It carries cumulative committed tokens, current position, reasoning tokens,
elapsed decode time/rate and, when present, cumulative speculative proposal and
acceptance facts. One terminal event carries the same final cumulative
speculative view. Default human logs render the rolling event; per-token
fragments and individual speculative phases require explicit detailed trace.

The rate record names its denominator. Cumulative decode is committed decode
work divided by complete decode wall; rolling decode is recent committed work
divided by its own recent duration, with a current maximum window of 32 tokens.
The compact server projection labels subsequent decode `decode-avg` and
`rolling[count/window]`; prefill and total-operation rates remain distinct.
Canonical JSON keeps
the complete scope, clock, composition, unit, work, duration, and rates. Human
abbreviations never replace the typed authority.

A completed stage profile also publishes an `unattributed` remainder. Its
`value_a` is the sum of disjoint measured host phases, `value_b` is total
generation wall, and `value_c` is the remainder. Attention, model-component,
and synchronization measurements are explicitly overlapping children and are
not subtracted again. If the disjoint clocks cannot be reconciled, the
remainder duration stays unavailable instead of manufacturing a negative or
double-counted wall.

Target-only first/subsequent decode timings own only the model step and remain
disjoint from output/state children. Speculative first/subsequent decode
timings enclose a complete draft/verify/commit iteration; nested output,
sampling, state, detokenization, and publication facts stay inspectable but
are excluded from the disjoint wall sum. The event composition field carries
that distinction explicitly.

Media progress is likewise server-authored. The interactive client may project
bounded completed/total iteration facts but does not fabricate percentages or
assistant prose. Component-open events distinguish full hash, verified reopen,
fallback hash, receipt state, bytes actually hashed, file extent, and elapsed
time. These authentication facts do not imply materialization or residency.

Engine load progress is authored by each lifecycle owner. Verification bytes
and residency tensors publish completed/total counts when a real denominator exists.
Binding, open, admission, materialization, seal, backend, or workspace phases
with no owned denominator retain unknown totals. Human server logs show counts,
elapsed time and available typed rates instead of progress percentages: token/s
for prefill/decode, binary byte/s for transfers, tensors/s or operations/s for
the corresponding load work. Prefill, subsequent-decode and total-operation
rates keep their scopes; unavailable rates are not invented. Progress is
coalesced; terminal lifecycle and failure evidence is retained.
The normal human prefill projection coalesces consecutive intermediate updates
at a one-second cadence; starts, terminal counts and request switches remain
visible. The verbose projection retains each supplied prefill update.

Speculative events carry availability-bearing named generation mode, cycle,
candidate extent, selected-verification, accepted, rejected, stop-discarded,
correction/bonus, promoted, replay, verification, confidence, timing, and
policy-identity facts. Legacy generic event counters remain part of the
versioned base event record but do not encode DSpark meaning. The human log
groups each request and its cycle summary; JSONL preserves the individual
events. The human watch log shows accepted/proposed token counts rather than
an acceptance percentage. Neither projection publishes draft token text.

## External HTTP access

The OpenAI adapter publishes transport observations into the same retained
event stream, including discovery with no inference. `request.received` follows
bounded HTTP parsing; `client.disconnected` records completion/refusal at the
end of the connection handler. Malformed HTTP has only the latter event.
These are transport facts, not model admission or authenticated client identity.

Within these event kinds, `phase=http:<route>` identifies an allowlisted method
and endpoint template, or `http:unsupported` / `http:invalid`. No raw path,
query, model selector, headers or body is copied into this phase. A host-local
`http-N` request ID correlates receipt and closure independently of model turn
IDs; a session ID is added when generation actually acquired a model session.
Process/sequence identity disambiguates restarts. The existing event counters
carry observed loopback peer port (`value_a`), first successfully written HTTP
status (`value_b`, zero means unavailable), and absolute YVEX error code
(`value_c`, zero means none). Closure duration covers the handler, including
request read and response execution, using the monotonic clock; it is not
model decode duration or socket admission-queue wait.

HTTP 200 does not prove a successful generation: SSE may fail or be cancelled
after its header was written. Human rows keep status and outcome separate.
Through an SSH tunnel the observed peer is the local forwarding endpoint;
neither that address nor a client-supplied header authenticates YAI or another
application. Authorization, forwarded-address and User-Agent headers are not
logged. This adds no transport, authentication or remote-serving capability.

## Privacy and content

Default telemetry excludes prompt text, response text, logits, hidden values,
tensor payloads, and KV contents. Explicit content tracing is opt-in, locally
scoped, and unsuitable for source control. Sensitive values and private paths
are not part of ordinary status or machine discovery.

## Timing and counters

CPU timings use a monotonic clock. CUDA device work uses device-complete timing
when kernel duration is claimed; asynchronous enqueue time is not kernel time.
Normal serving does not add synchronizations merely for telemetry.

Draft and verification durations are reported separately from committed
generation rate. Proposed tokens never contribute to generated-token or
completion-usage counters; accepted-prefix and correction/bonus accounting is
explicit.

Unavailable timing or placement fields are marked unavailable. Counters name
actual target/draft forwards and rows, verifications, accepted/promoted/replayed
rows, state copies and candidate bytes, output-head rows, logits movement,
full-array scans/digests, row/expert pairs and unique experts, launches, graph
launches, waits, synchronizations, allocations, shape hits/misses/rebuilds,
expert-worklist counts, pair/bucket counts, maximum bucket width, narrow rows,
bounded tails and Tensor Core eligible/executed rows, multi-source physical
batch counts, real rows and source counts, and the multi-source expert-bucket
population histogram. These are publication facts rather than values inferred
from tensor sizes. A measured
zero synchronization duration is never interpreted as zero synchronization
cost.

## Observability cost

Correctness-required execution, normal operational telemetry, and detailed
profiling are distinct modes. The minimal mode exists for controlled
qualification; the product default uses bounded summary/stage events; detailed
profiling may publish materially more attribution and must disclose its cost.
Changing observability does not change semantic generation-plan identity.

Normal telemetry performs no measurement-only device or stream synchronization,
keeps ring/event volume bounded, and is qualified with paired whole-model runs
against a predeclared variance/overhead limit. Detailed profiling is not a
release benchmark mode. Output identity, execution identity, warm/cold state,
device, contention, and workload remain fixed in a paired comparison; the run
manifest records the intentionally different observability condition.

## Side effects and failure

Event publication may update bounded metrics and subscriber queues or write an
explicitly selected console/trace sink. It does not mutate model state.
Serialization, sink, overflow, and subscriber failures remain distinguishable
and cannot fabricate a successful runtime operation.

## Compatibility and non-claims

Raw event and status schemas are versioned independently of human rendering.
Telemetry is not evaluation, benchmark authority, conversation history,
release evidence by itself, or a public monitoring service.
