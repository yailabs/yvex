# YVEX Project Control

Date: 2026-07-22
Status: living engineering control
Authority: product target, architecture tracks, complete wave ledger, milestone
state, dependencies, evidence rank, family scope, release gates, and Active Next
Recovery baseline: pre-refoundation `docs/spine.md` at commit `10ad6c3`
Current proof stage: the common sealed runtime model/session executes resident DeepSeek attention through CPU eager and GB10 CUDA eager/graph modes; persistent family-correct KV is the active boundary

## 1. Authority And Update Contract

`PROJECT.md` is the single project-control authority for YVEX. It is the map
used by maintainers and agents to answer, without consulting Git history:

- what YVEX is building;
- which target closes the current release;
- which model-family and common engineering work already exists;
- which stable architecture track owns a change;
- which conclusive milestone is active;
- which wave IDs are complete, planned, blocked, reopened, deferred, partial,
  superseded, or not measured;
- which report, fixture, selected proof, CLI, topology, and diagnostic rows
  remain useful;
- which milestone consumes each subordinate row;
- which dependency and release gate a milestone closes.

Git history is recovery evidence, not a substitute for current project state.
No row may silently disappear, change owner, change ID, or be merged. Record an
explicit migration or successor when project structure changes.

No second authority, compatibility copy, redirect, archive, or shadow ledger
may exist. Technical contracts, API references, runbooks, and point-in-time
audits may live elsewhere, but none owns the track registry, wave state, Active
Next, family matrix, critical path, or release truth.

### 1.1 Atomic Update Rule

At milestone start and closure, update in one patch:

1. milestone state and exact before/after capability;
2. owning track summary and calculated counts;
3. dependencies and newly unblocked successor;
4. evidence added, completed, absorbed, reopened, or superseded;
5. affected model-family scopes;
6. release gates and non-claims;
7. the single Active Next.

A new row has exactly one stable ID and one owning track. Only a `milestone`
row may become Active Next.

## 2. Rank, State, And Proof Semantics

Rank states what a row can prove. State says what happened to that exact row.
They are independent: a complete report remains evidence, not a milestone.

| Rank | Meaning | Independently schedulable | May close a product gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `milestone` | Conclusive architectural or functional after-state with one owner, a real downstream consumer, hard acceptance, tests, and a dependency transition | yes, when Active Next | only its owned gate |
| `capability` | Durable implemented behavior below a product gate | no | no by itself |
| `evidence` | Report, fixture, selected proof, diagnostic state, reference comparison, trace, audit, checksum, or bounded fact | no | no |
| `subtask` | Retained requirement assigned to a conclusive milestone | no | no |
| `migration` | Superseded project structure or naming marker with an explicit successor | no | no |
| `future` | Deferred post-v0.1 work requiring a later scope decision | no | no |

| State | Exact meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `complete` | The row outcome is implemented and validated at its declared rank and proof stage |
| `active` | The single current first-class milestone |
| `partial` | Useful work landed, but the stated milestone outcome did not close |
| `blocked` | A milestone has unmet predecessors |
| `planned` | A retained requirement or non-active supporting milestone |
| `reopened` | Earlier evidence was narrower than the claimed boundary |
| `not-measured` | Benchmark evidence does not exist |
| `deferred` | Explicitly outside the active release |
| `superseded` | Replaced and retained only for traceability |

A row is not milestone-complete merely because it adds a report, CLI command,
structured output, fixture, selected tensor, wrapper, source move, plan, or
documentation. Those are evidence or subtasks unless the same row implements
and tests a conclusive downstream-consumed after-state.

## 3. Product, Release, And Engineering Scope

### 3.1 v0.1.0 Product Outcome

YVEX generates real text with DeepSeek-V4-Flash on the DGX Spark CUDA backend
from a complete GGUF artifact produced by YVEX.

Canonical source:

```text
$HOME/lab/models/hf/deepseek/DeepSeek-V4-Flash
```

Future canonical full target:

```text
deepseek4-v4-flash
```

The existing aliases remain bounded proof surfaces until an owning milestone
absorbs or removes them:

```text
deepseek4-v4-flash-selected-embed
deepseek4-v4-flash-selected-embed-rmsnorm
```

They are not supported targets, complete model artifacts, or release-path
stages. The selected v0.1.0 physical profile is
`deepseek-v4-flash-q8_0-q2_k-v1`: exact scalar roles remain F32, BF16, or I32,
ordinary quantizable matrices use Q8_0, and routed-expert tensors use Q2_K.
Its encoded payload is 102,396,843,592 bytes. This is measured quantization
evidence, not a DGX Spark residency or runtime-fit claim.

DeepSeek-V4-Flash is the only model whose complete source-to-text chain closes
v0.1.0. This release decision does not make DeepSeek the only engineering
scope.

### 3.2 Multi-Family Engineering Scope

Source intake, tensor mapping, qtypes, GGUF, integrity, materialization,
residency, descriptor projection, backend operation, operator, evaluation, and
release owners remain reusable and family-aware.

Qwen, Gemma, and dense/common work already implemented remains active project
state at its truthful rank. It supplies real regression evidence and prevents
DeepSeek-specific behavior from leaking into common owners. It does not claim
Qwen or Gemma runtime generation. GLM remains planned and does not require a
canonical runbook until implementation starts.

Family-specific architecture, tokenizer, attention, position, KV, MoE, and
execution behavior enter through typed profiles and explicit milestones. Common
owners must not branch on ad hoc target strings when a typed family boundary is
required.

### 3.3 Real Generation Contract

```text
prompt text
-> exact tokenizer
-> full prefill
-> family-correct attention, position handling and MoE
-> real KV writes
-> repeated decode that reads prior KV
-> final norm and complete output head
-> vocabulary logits
-> sampling
-> token append and stop policy
-> detokenized text
```

The complete chain must execute over the complete YVEX-produced GGUF for the
exact target. CLI acceptance, selected tensors, synthetic logits, reports,
printed fixture tokens, and bounded diagnostic loops do not satisfy it.

### 3.4 Artifact Terminology

| Term | Canonical meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Tensor proof artifact | One tensor or a bounded subset used to prove only a named parser, layout, materialization, primitive, or lifecycle property |
| Complete model artifact | Every tensor and metadata item required to execute one exact model target |
| Supported model artifact | A complete artifact that passes integrity, materialization, runtime, generation, evaluation, benchmark, and release gates |

The unqualified term "model artifact" never means a selected-tensor proof file.

### 3.5 Model Compilation Boundaries

YVEX treats model compilation and model execution as related but non-equivalent
systems. A logical model is identified by its verified source and family-correct
semantics, not by GGUF or another physical container. GGUF remains the required
v0.1.0 release container and one concrete physical lowering of that logical
model.

| Boundary | Owned meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Source snapshot | Exact repository, revision, configuration, tokenizer, index, shard, source-tensor, and metadata identity. |
| Payload capability | Trusted or locally sealed bytes exposed through immutable ranges, bounded reads, resource limits, cancellation, and transactional delivery. |
| Logical model | Architecture semantics and canonical tensor roles independent of container, qtype, placement, and backend. |
| Transformation plan | Immutable artifact-neutral operations deriving physical tensor values from exact logical source contributions without reading payload bytes. |
| Physical model variant | One identified result of lowering a transformation plan under explicit artifact, precision, hardware, memory, quality, and workload constraints. |
| Artifact serialization | A concrete external representation of one physical variant; GGUF is the v0.1.0 representation. |
| Materialization | An admitted artifact's immutable tensor bindings and bounded access/session lifecycle; it is neither serialization nor execution. |
| Runtime binding | A content-addressed immutable association among the physical variant, admitted artifact, materialization facts, runtime descriptor, attention plan, residency requirements, and backend requirements; mutable execution state remains session-owned. |
| Execution evidence | Correctness, quality, memory, IO, and performance measurements bound to an exact source, plan, variant, machine, and workload. |

The planning plane is metadata-only:

```text
verified source facts
-> architecture IR
-> tensor coverage
-> source contribution map
-> transformation IR
-> physical lowering plan
```

The byte-execution plane consumes the already verified source-byte capability:

```text
verified payload session
-> exact bounded source chunks
-> transformation execution
-> quantization/conversion
-> artifact writer
```

Planning does not read model payload bytes. Payload readers do not interpret
family roles or transformation semantics. Quantization consumes canonical
transformation truth and may not rediscover source names, roles, aggregation
axes, or scaling companions.

Future variant planning is a constrained multi-objective problem. For source
model `S`, hardware profile `H`, workload profile `W`, and candidate plan `p`,
admission requires at least:

```text
coverage(p) = 1
payload_binding(S, p) = 1
capability(H, p) = 1
memory(p, H) <= M_H
quality_drift(p, W) <= epsilon
```

An admitted planner exposes a Pareto set; it does not claim one universal
optimum. Predicted estimates remain distinct from measurements owned by
`TRACK.EVAL` and `TRACK.BENCH`. Evidence may eventually bind artifact build
time and size, payload and transformation bytes, load time, time to first
token, prefill/decode throughput, storage-tier peaks, KV, scratch, SSD traffic
and stalls, quality drift, and energy only when an owning measurement exists.

The memory model distinguishes source storage, artifact storage, SSD staging,
future inference-time SSD tensor streaming, host memory, unified memory, device
memory, persistent KV, and temporary scratch. Completed source payload
streaming is build-time source access; it is not inference-time SSD expert
streaming.

### 3.6 Engineering Construction Method

YVEX is constructed through human-directed, repository-grounded, independently
verified state transitions. The method separates architectural authority,
reasoning assistance, repository implementation, and acceptance so that no
conversation, prompt, agent, or report can promote itself into project truth.

#### Authority And Roles

The human project authority owns the product outcome, scope, priority,
trade-offs, architectural judgment, interpretation of evidence, and final
acceptance or rejection. Reasoning LLMs and repository coding agents assist
that authority; neither replaces it.

| Role | Owned contribution | Explicit non-ownership |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Human project authority | Chooses product direction, scopes work, resolves trade-offs, judges architecture, interprets evidence, and accepts or rejects results. | Does not delegate project authority merely by requesting analysis or implementation. |
| Reasoning LLM | Compresses large repository contexts, studies primary sources and mature implementations, compares alternatives, exposes hidden assumptions, separates facts from inferences and proposals, and compiles intent into ownership and acceptance criteria. | Does not own repository truth, capability state, or capability promotion. |
| Repository coding agent | Reads the actual owners and contracts, implements one bounded delta, chooses coherent internal APIs after inspection, tests success/refusal/failure/cleanup, and produces a candidate patch, commit, and closure assertion. | Does not redefine the product outcome or certify its own candidate as accepted truth. |
| Independent verifier | Reconstructs the accepted baseline, reads the complete remote diff, checks ownership and consumers, executes proportionate validation, audits claims and project-state changes, and returns pass or repair. | Does not infer acceptance from the implementation agent's report or activity volume. |
| Repository | Stores the accepted implementation, contracts, tests, guards, evidence boundaries, and project decisions used by later work. | Does not treat chat history, prompts, or unmerged candidates as durable state. |

Conversations are exploratory working memory. The repository is durable project
memory. Any conclusion that changes later implementation must become an owned
contract, type boundary, test, guard, acceptance criterion, reference decision,
or explicit project-control update. Chat transcripts, delivery prompts, and
closure reports may explain a candidate; they never substitute for the current
repository.

#### Delivery And Candidate Implementation

A delivery is the intermediate representation between architectural intent and
a repository patch. A technical delivery combines:

```text
persistent repository contracts
+ one row-specific delta
+ mandatory ownership
+ implementation freedom inside that ownership
+ hard acceptance criteria
+ focused and complete validation
```

The delivery defines the required after-state and forbidden shortcuts. It does
not invent a final internal API before the coding agent has inspected current
types, owners, consumers, failure conventions, and tests. Implementation freedom
never overrides the mandatory boundary or acceptance criteria.

The coding agent's closure report is an assertion requiring independent
verification. The verifier checks the remote commit and baseline, complete
diff, owner placement, real consumers, duplicate state, focused tests, full
validation where applicable, refusal/failure/cleanup behavior, claim limits,
and any proposed project transition. An implementation candidate may contain
an atomic ledger transition, but no successor implementation proceeds until
that closure is accepted. Rejection preserves the previously accepted state
and produces a repair delta or reopens the same outcome before progression.

Progress is the sequence of accepted state transitions and behavior consumed
by a real downstream owner. Token use, session duration, diff size, file count,
report length, generated-code volume, relocation, renaming, and diagnostic
output alone are not completion evidence.

#### Vertical-First Generalization

YVEX develops common architecture under pressure from exact working verticals:

```text
exact vertical
-> implementation pressure
-> observed invariant
-> common owner
-> second-family pressure
-> harden or split
-> preserved working verticals
```

DeepSeek-V4-Flash is the current release vertical and supplies concrete
attention, mHC, MoE, low-precision, payload, and memory constraints. It is not
permission to put DeepSeek names or semantics into common source, qtype, GGUF,
artifact, residency, backend, or runtime owners. Qwen, Gemma, and later exact
models act as falsifiers of common assumptions even when they are not release
targets.

A mechanism may be common from its first consumer when its contract is
intrinsically format-, storage-, arithmetic-, lifecycle-, or backend-general.
Model semantics remain family-specific until repeated evidence establishes a
stable invariant. When another family contradicts an abstraction, strengthen
the common contract or split ownership at the real semantic boundary. Never
add a target-name conditional to conceal the contradiction, and never weaken a
working vertical to preserve a false abstraction.

#### References, Audit, And Learning Feedback

Primary model sources and papers define model semantics. Specifications define
formats and ABIs. Mature repositories provide comparative implementation
evidence. Hardware documentation defines physical constraints. Only YVEX tests
and identity-bound measurements determine YVEX capability. Reusing an external
design transfers none of its API, process topology, support matrix, benchmark,
or claim.

Implementation is also an architectural experiment. A false assumption,
missing constraint, misplaced owner, invalid abstraction, or inadequate test
revealed by a wave must return to persistent contracts before later work
depends on it. The source-payload/Transformation-IR separation is one such
feedback transition: implementation evidence showed that byte delivery and
transformation semantics require distinct owners. Knowledge that remains only
in a conversation or closure report is not part of the architecture.

## 4. Current Hard Truth

| Boundary | Current truth |
| --- | --- |
| Project control | The 631-ID historical ledger is recovered and ranked here, then organized across 26 canonical tracks; project recovery, compilation-architecture rebasing, the public README cutover, repository semantic compression, and C canonicalization are complete. `TRACK.RUNTIME` now owns the common runtime lifecycle without changing the 681-ID canonical set. `config/source_owners.tsv` registers every production source/header exactly once; explicit header tiers, source-relative object/archive identities, semantic contracts, and repository layout, ownership, dependency, complexity, and ABI gates are hard failures. |
| Source | The canonical DeepSeek target is verified against `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash` at commit `60d8d70770c6776ff598c94bb586a859a38244f1`. The pinned upstream index, structured configs, tokenizer assets, 46/46 safetensors headers, 69,187 unique tensor records, and verifier-owned manifest agree. Manifest v3 binds every shard to its authoritative Hugging Face Git LFS SHA-256 and atomically publishes aggregate payload identity `e22b3678d131d334f154a93214bdddfafc172c9869f4c52db28fea198eaa9165` only after all 159,617,149,040 shard-file bytes pass digest and drift checks. |
| Family profiles | The exact DeepSeek-V4-Flash source projects to one immutable typed IR with 43 main layers, one MTP layer, explicit SWA/CSA/HCA, mHC, MoE, position/KV, output, tokenizer, and source constraints. Runtime numeric schema v2 binds BF16/F32 compute boundaries, activation fake-quantization, UE8M0 scaling, deterministic top-k, and the full Hadamard authority at commit `e7706faf8d1c3b9f241e36860640ad1dac644ede`. SWA uses base RoPE without YaRN; compressed CSA/HCA classes use the versioned YaRN policy. Qwen, Gemma, and dense/MoE evidence remains at its prior rank. |
| Tensor coverage | One immutable IR-derived requirement set reconciles exactly against all 69,187 tensors in the verified DeepSeek snapshot: every entry is assigned once, with zero missing, duplicate, ambiguous, unsupported, or unexpected tensors and zero payload reads. Qwen/Gemma evidence remains at its prior rank. |
| Mapping | The sealed artifact-neutral Transformation IR now projects to 1,360 immutable GGUF lowering descriptors: 1,328 pinned-standard trunk descriptors and 32 explicit YVEX MTP extension descriptors. The GGUF adapter adds names, qtypes, metadata, and emitted layout without reconstructing transformation semantics; all 69,187 contributions and mapping identity `1aecbbe25b04de0d` remain exact. |
| Compilation | Schema-v1 immutable Transformation IR owns 69,187 source values, 1,360 typed operations and terminal logical outputs, 69,187 edges, deterministic topology, checked shapes/dtypes/axes, canonical identity `cc774dffb6aa3a8e9f507b1dd454fbf7f5c68187138736f9a330ee9eaec07067`, and an exhaustive payload-range/quantizer binding. Planning reads zero payload bytes. One fixed versioned DeepSeek physical profile consumes this truth; automatic optimization, multi-variant compilation, placement selection, and feedback-driven selection remain deferred. |
| GGUF foundations | The canonical row-aware qtype storage ABI, scalable native GGUF v3 structural reader ABI, and global directory-order layout admission are closed. `V010.GGUF.ARTIFACT.ABI.0` remains reopened as bounded historical evidence. |
| Qtype | Pinned GGUF identities, removed/outside-baseline refusal, exact scalar/block geometry, and shape-aware storage accounting are canonical. One numeric capability registry owns deterministic codec and CPU/CUDA compute truth. F32, F16, BF16, I32, Q8_0, Q2_K, and MXFP4 codecs, direct encoded row-dot proofs, the selected DeepSeek profile, and the bounded four-operation byte executor are complete; unsupported identities refuse explicitly. |
| Artifact | One immutable GGUF v3 writer plan consumes canonical lowering, quantization, tokenizer, and provenance owners. It emitted the complete source-faithful and selected DeepSeek artifacts outside the repository: `deepseek-v4-flash-source-faithful-v1.gguf` is 177,680,573,600 bytes with identity `f16e800c0d7383ee76cb2e2fa8bdd674bab29c017cba64eaba85c39016e257ca`; `deepseek-v4-flash-q8_0-q2_k-v1.gguf` is 102,408,545,440 bytes with identity `01b2bed4f070d0a3fdb02e546764b3a49cb69886eebe17b4877d20294725682c`. Each contains 68 metadata entries, exact tokenizer material, and all 1,360 tensors. The selected artifact is consumed by materialization and attention execution; it is not supported-model evidence. |
| Integrity | Canonical layout admission, full-file SHA-256 identity, exact payload-range verification, native writer-reader equivalence, pinned official ggml reader acceptance, deterministic second serialization, and complete-artifact support admission are closed for both DeepSeek artifacts. Tensor proofs and external or structurally incomplete GGUF files remain outside the complete-artifact path. |
| Materialization | The admitted selected DeepSeek artifact has a canonical family-neutral materialization plan and committed session over all 1,360 tensors. The live proof walked all 102,396,843,592 encoded payload bytes through bounded file-backed/staged access with 16 MiB peak executor-owned staging and 33,792 expert subviews. Attention consumes those bindings; complete-model backend residency and higher transformer execution remain unsupported. |
| Runtime descriptor | The common runtime descriptor and DeepSeek specialization project the admitted artifact, materialization plan, canonical qtype facts, all 1,360 tensor bindings, topology, MoE/expert geometry, output/vocabulary geometry, tokenizer availability, and runtime numeric authority into one immutable graph-input descriptor. Logical-model identity `ec22b4bf78811265d1881071919593991f33ab883303f3df16d64c0689a63950`, runtime-numeric identity `33182fd6b75e9263861d5a873550e6d0c5d5010267fb315ec687c693c9572dcd`, and runtime-descriptor identity `61e25532554505b1536e8ec11198b680ca812e0cdc8f2966a6f6652103a95574` are distinct from unchanged artifact and materialization identities. |
| Runtime | One content-addressed runtime binding opens the admitted artifact into a sealed family-neutral runtime model and process-lifetime execution sessions. DeepSeek enters through a typed adapter. The model authenticates and parses once and owns immutable resident attention weights; each session owns mutable state, stable workspace, and its CUDA Graph registry. Semantic, executable, CUDA launch, and graph-exec identities remain distinct. Attention prefill/decode probes execute through CPU eager and GB10 CUDA eager, piecewise-graph, full-graph, and deterministic auto dispatch. Warm execution rebuilds no source, Transformation IR, quantization, or writer plan. Persistent KV, full-model prefill/decode, transformer composition, and generation remain unsupported. |
| CUDA | Production C contains no fallback PTX. Context, Driver API memory operations, generated-bundle admission, resolved functions, exact variants, and runtime-session CUDA Graph lifecycles are distinct typed facts. A no-`nvcc` build refuses every kernel before dispatch. Complete resident DeepSeek attention is admitted on the generated-bundle GB10 path through eager, piecewise, and full graph modes with direct independent-reference parity and no CPU numerical fallback. |
| Transformer | The immutable DeepSeek attention plan drives complete SWA/CSA/HCA core and immediate attention-envelope execution through independent full-equation reference, production CPU, and device-complete GB10 CUDA paths over all 43 layers and 634 core bindings. Persistent runtime KV, FFN/MoE, complete transformer composition, and final model output remain unsupported. |
| Operator | The `yvex graph attention` namespace invokes the production runtime directly over the admitted external artifact and runtime binding. It exposes preparation, description, capabilities, planning, phase-aware execution, comparison, state, residency, CUDA Graph, trace, profile, benchmark, and deterministic chart evidence without accepting prompt text or claiming generation. |
| Text path | Exact tokenizer-backed autoregressive DeepSeek text generation is unsupported. |
| Evaluation | No release-path generation evaluation exists. |
| Benchmark | The runtime owns bounded attention cold/warm, eager/piecewise/full measurements, identity-bound baseline comparison, JSON/CSV facts, and deterministic external SVG charts. Release-path generation and full-model benchmark evidence remain not measured. |
| Release | Blocked. |

The admitted runtime capability lattice is explicit. Compatibility umbrella
flags are derived from these facts and are not independent authorities:

Repository compression and C canonicalization preserved every admitted source,
payload, GGUF mapping, quantization profile, artifact, and materialization
identity. The canonicalization baseline contained 306 owned C/CUDA/header
files, 164 translation units, and 142 headers. Its accepted pre-runtime closure
contained 198 production files, 159 translation units, 39 headers, 174 test
files, 84 C/CUDA/header test files, and 196 semantic owners.

Runtime canonicalization deletes 36 production files and adds six, leaving 168
production files: 131 C translation units, one CUDA translation unit, and 36
headers. The test tree contains 153 files, including 77 C/CUDA/header test
files. The headers comprise 13 installed public, 17 explicit internal, and six
source-local contracts. Mechanical same-stem pairs, production umbrella
imports, ambiguous bare internal includes, basename violations, and
project-prefix violations remain zero.

Physical production lines changed from 131,559 to 129,797, a net removal of
1,762 lines; code lines changed from 115,138 to 107,240, and executable lines
from 77,367 to 65,963. All 2,992 production functions have adjacent contracts;
2,403 non-trivial functions carry the complete semantic contract. Functions
above 200 lines are zero, the largest function is 200 lines, the largest
translation unit is 1,996 lines, and the hard line-width violation count is
zero.

The static archive changed from 116 members with only 95 unique identities to
98 source-relative members with 98 unique identities. Library-global symbols
fell from 969 to 867: 326 public and 541 non-public. Semantic owners fell from
230 at the canonicalization baseline and 196 at the pre-runtime closure to 165;
162 owners have one file and three have two. DeepSeek uses exactly its admitted
family budget of three sources and one header. The current tree has zero
one-consumer private headers, duplicate definitions, include cycles, forbidden
dependency edges, unregistered files, family-budget violations, or
layout/ownership exceptions. Manifest, Makefile source, source-relative object,
and archive-member parity are exact. The canonical ownership, layout,
architecture, and code-naturalness gates enforce these facts without promoting
persistent KV, runtime generation, or any higher inference capability.

Strict source proof consumes the pinned upstream index with Git OID
`84692cbe7af556a01e2e5353341100079c387aee`, validates the exact model,
tokenizer, and generation config structure, and reads 69,187 unique tensor
records from 46/46 safetensors headers in one canonical pass. The verified
local footprint is 159,629,046,930 bytes after admission of the index and its
provider metadata. The verifier now admits the 46 authoritative Git LFS
SHA-256 facts, streams all 159,617,149,040 shard-file bytes through the common
payload reader, and atomically publishes manifest v3 only after every digest,
file identity, and aggregate identity succeeds. A local-only seal remains a
distinct `local_payload_snapshot_sealed` trust class and is never promoted to
upstream verification.

The global layout proof matches pinned ggml
`af97976c7810cdabb1863172f31c432dab767de7`: alignment is power-of-two,
directory and physical order agree, every relative offset equals the previous
padded end, required padding is zero, and the exact padded file span is
snapshot-safe. The 69,187-tensor scale proof is linear and reads zero tensor
payload bytes. Layout admission remains a container property, not complete
model-artifact support.

CUDA capability admission now consumes only the generated
`kernels.cu` bundle. A baseline build without `nvcc` keeps context and
proven Driver API memory/transfer facts while refusing all kernel variants
before dispatch. On NVIDIA GB10, F32/F16 embedding, F32 RMSNorm with F32/F16
weights, F32 RoPE/matmul, bounded dense/routed F32 MLP, and bounded
causal/non-causal F32 attention resolve atomically and pass independent
reference comparisons. Module/function rollback, launch/sync failure, output
state, temporary allocation, and checked cleanup fail closed. This completes
CUDA capability truthfulness, not the v0.1.0 DeepSeek backend gate.

The canonical architecture IR consumes one successful exact-source result and
does not reopen config, tokenizer, index, or shard headers. It owns 43 explicit
main-layer descriptors plus one MTP descriptor: 2 SWA, 21 CSA, and 20 HCA main
layers; 3 token-ID hash routers and 40 hidden-state learned routers; four mHC
residual streams over a 16,384-wide expanded state; an untied 129,280-entry
output head; and the exact tokenizer and BF16/FP4/FP8 source constraints. The
live proof scanned 46 headers once, observed 69,187 tensor records, and read
zero tensor payload bytes. Paper `arXiv:2606.19348v1`, SGLang
`96a04cb13f9c3ed86028e090784a9eb059cf5318`, and vLLM
`8df14cfc8c8a09b4e57f082e59593a3abce4ffb3` are the pinned interpretation
baselines. This closes architecture semantics only; tensor-role coverage is
owned separately.

The coverage owner derives 69,187 typed requirements from that IR and matches
them one-to-one against the retained upstream-indexed snapshot without
reopening any shard. The closed inventory contains 6 global, 572 attention,
164 compressor, 147 indexer, 88 normalization, 264 mHC, 88 router, 67,584
routed-expert, 264 shared-expert, and 10 auxiliary tensors. Indexed lookup and
deterministic iteration make the pass linear at target scale; the live proof
performs one header scan and reads zero payload bytes. Coverage does not choose
GGUF names, transformations, emitted layouts, or payload policy.

The canonical DeepSeek GGUF map now consumes the sealed Transformation IR
without reopening source metadata or independently constructing transformation
truth. It projects all 69,187 source values into 1,360 logical outputs: 1,328
standard trunk descriptors and 32 namespaced MTP extension descriptors. The
adapter adds GGUF names, forced source-format qtypes, metadata, emitted layout,
and deterministic source/emitted/role indexes. Descriptor-by-descriptor tests
preserve mapping identity `1aecbbe25b04de0d`; payload conversion, writer bytes,
and runtime behavior remain outside the mapping owner.

The payload handoff consumes the same retained snapshot and map. It builds
immutable O(1)-expected shard and tensor indexes, checked absolute ranges, and
physical-order page/chunk plans without reparsing headers. A verified session
uses secure relative paths, `openat`/`O_NOFOLLOW`, regular-file and replacement
checks, bounded pinned LRU handles, one bounded reusable buffer, exact
`pread`-style loops, cancellation, and transactional begin/chunk/commit or
abort delivery. The live trust-and-deliver pass resolved all 69,187 mapping
contributions and 1,360 descriptors, delivered 159,609,485,896 logical bytes,
and observed zero short reads, digest mismatches, or identity drift. This is a
source payload capability for the future transformation executor; it performs
no conversion, quantization, GGUF emission, artifact admission,
materialization, or runtime execution.

The compilation owner now seals an artifact-neutral schema-v1 DAG before any
physical lowering. The complete DeepSeek plan contains 69,187 canonical source
values, 1,360 terminal values and nodes, 69,187 edges, maximum fan-in 512, and
maximum depth one. Its closed operations comprise 850 identity transfers, 375
scale-paired decodes, three checked integer casts, and 132 expert-axis
aggregations. Canonical SHA-256 encoding excludes allocation order, pointers,
local paths, GGUF names, qtypes, and artifact offsets. The quantizer binding
resolves all 69,187 source values to matching manifest-admitted payload ranges
while retaining source snapshot, required payload, and Transformation IR
identities as distinct facts. The live plan performs one retained header pass
and zero payload reads. `V010.QUANT.2` now consumes this immutable truth rather
than rediscovering source roles, companions, aggregation axes, or logical
shapes.

The quantization owner consumes that sealed DAG and exact payload binding
through profile `deepseek-v4-flash-q8_0-q2_k-v1`. The current plan-only
derivation has identity
`431696b26898bbc98ef0a8de2e8c8992f2771d631aaa53a446c089b7d4fca1fb`;
the immutable artifact already admitted by the repository retains its executed
physical-profile identity
`04be09e124fd997ae3b785d0d3018f9d571cb6b96df5488d0ab21de3345bce25`.
All 1,360 terminal decisions biject the GGUF lowering descriptors: 417 F32,
433 BF16, three I32, 375 Q8_0, and 132 Q2_K tensors. The complete read-only
execution consumed all 69,187 trusted ranges and 159,609,485,896 payload bytes,
committed 102,396,843,592 encoded bytes to a digest/discard sink, and produced
execution identity
`b81f3c5d670737bf20c938e635a1bffdbb0d60f885f994225a02225bb7ba51db`.
Q8_0 maximum absolute error/RMSE were 0.0146484375/0.00016908988226012133;
Q2_K values were 0.507720947265625/0.0076422877123441847. Derived block bounds,
role-grouped metrics, independent reference decoding, and direct CPU/CUDA
encoded-row compute passed with zero numeric-bound violations, short reads,
payload drift, sink failures, aborted terminals, or incomplete terminals. The
profile explicitly requires no calibration; `V010.QUANT.3` remains planned for
future profiles that require calibration evidence. Materialization, residency,
runtime, transformer, and generation support remain unpromoted.

The artifact owner now consumes the lowering and quantization owners through
immutable GGUF v3 writer plans. The published source-faithful plan identity
`3bcd8e5bd58fc05684121a05ee87c13c14dcf09f379ca37f06e0361591d06eb0`
produced 177,668,871,752 tensor payload bytes in a 177,680,573,600-byte file;
the published selected plan identity
`4b47814e06c43b3426efcaab72b836596c42358a7c59ea5619ddd70c0eefe9fd`
produced 102,396,843,592 tensor payload bytes in a 102,408,545,440-byte file.
Plan-only re-derivation over the current runtime-numeric-aware transformation
identity yields `9dc39cf987270562859238ba423a3f17b1d3c11c1f2e049516866a853c600a84`
and `db0344991f10237119b32152a8c4ccb6bffc31f968464820a1a74e13590c7b30`,
respectively, with zero payload reads and no artifact publication.
Both artifacts contain 47 lowering metadata entries plus 21 exact
artifact/tokenizer/provenance entries, 129,280 tokenizer tokens, 127,741
merges, and all 1,360 tensors. Native YVEX full-byte roundtrip, the pinned
official ggml reader at
`af97976c7810cdabb1863172f31c432dab767de7`, and a second complete selected
serialization accepted identical structure and bytes. Artifact identities
`f16e800c0d7383ee76cb2e2fa8bdd674bab29c017cba64eaba85c39016e257ca`
and `01b2bed4f070d0a3fdb02e546764b3a49cb69886eebe17b4877d20294725682c`
bind the exact physical files independently from their quantization execution
identities. The complete-artifact gate admits those immutable snapshots for
materialization; it does not claim residency, runtime execution, transformer
execution, or generation.

The admitted attention executor consumes the immutable DeepSeek runtime
descriptor and materialized encoded weights through attention plan identity
`45061c65a16e2bf0d773f620f0ca42fa1ddbac71a5e11fb8cf5028886e564a18`.
An independent test-only full-equation reference and the production CPU and
generated-bundle CUDA paths execute all 43 main layers and 634 bindings: two
SWA, 21 CSA, and 20 HCA descriptors. Rolling compression, selected compressed
history, deterministic top-k, causal/class masks, stable softmax, reduction,
and output projection are numerical dependencies rather than report facts.
SWA applies base RoPE without YaRN. CSA and HCA apply the compressed-class YaRN
policy; HCA emits complete non-overlapping groups at the exact ratio 128,
retains an incomplete tail as raw local history, and lets raw and compressed
representations participate without cross-representation deduplication.

The complete live comparison covered 6,772,096 values and observed zero
maximum absolute error, zero maximum relative error, and zero finite-only RMSE
for reference/CPU, reference/CUDA, and CPU/CUDA comparisons on GB10 compute
capability 12.1. CPU/CUDA comparison admission uses versioned comparison schema
v2: every finite pair must satisfy
`abs(a - b) <= 5e-4 + 5e-4 * max(abs(a), abs(b))`, non-finite values refuse,
and RMSE is accumulated only over finite pairs. Raw object-byte comparison
also observed bitwise equality for this evidence run, but bitwise equality is
not required and no causal explanation is inferred from that observation.
The completed `V010.GRAPH.DEEPSEEK.ATTENTION.0` checkpoint recorded historical
attention execution evidence identity
`f4afb4a97ef13c7f7d5805509dbffdbbf15bdc10a933e7b0a0871733238833e5`;
independent-oracle trace and output identities are
`96a0ff53a4bfb82c3d1db1f3dce2694e1d1500eb5c305dbd5470978bf5e16435`
and `c6952cf145632719458cbca26ef26c4f03cc5543f22f21072e223c3a14338128`.
They remain provenance for that closed milestone and are not current runtime
model/session benchmark identities.
The earlier `fd635d6a820cd5bda00e88bd1fc5eff649ac990f9667120c49b4c3bf811ba858`
was bounded, unversioned checkpoint evidence; it is superseded and is not
repurposed as complete execution evidence. The owner now reports
`attention_execution_supported=1`, `attention_cuda_execution_ready=1`, and
`runtime_generation_ready=0`. Persistent KV, prefill, MoE, transformer
composition, model decode, logits, sampling, generation,
evaluation, full-model benchmarking, and release remain separate unsupported
or blocked boundaries.
Here `prefill` names tokenizer-backed full-model prompt prefill, not the admitted
attention-local activation-chunk phase.

Correcting the false checkpoint assumption that applied YaRN to SWA, and
binding explicit BF16/F32 compute semantics in runtime-numeric schema v2,
changed semantic derivation identities without changing physical artifact
bytes. Logical model
`034b6a0fe8969f878e8a455d4829219495dd5e5614ff4288712e3b4b02b5ccc5` became

Transformation IR

`cc774dffb6aa3a8e9f507b1dd454fbf7f5c68187138736f9a330ee9eaec07067`;
runtime numeric

and attention plan
`013ff42a92125471ea40f3831358c77435afc0f33c730e24f85a4e2897307351` became
`154761f606f2c5cbf2464f1446bc98374cf8071029bb898ffaab72291135db25`.
The runtime envelope admission then versioned that plan from
`154761f606f2c5cbf2464f1446bc98374cf8071029bb898ffaab72291135db25`
to `a562cf9949c01d25cebe5c0669664a11045f4426e523334c1eccdcc94650b5b4`
by binding the immediate mHC ingress, input normalization, residual egress,
and envelope output geometry. Runtime attention-plan schema v3 then produced
`45061c65a16e2bf0d773f620f0ca42fa1ddbac71a5e11fb8cf5028886e564a18`
by additionally binding the exact required envelope-binding count used by
runtime residency. Artifact and materialization bytes remain unchanged.
Derived quant profile
`d28393a69f51e9909602f2a68eaaf380705805845dfd43579bc5f81ba1be22a4` became
`431696b26898bbc98ef0a8de2e8c8992f2771d631aaa53a446c089b7d4fca1fb`.
Source-faithful/selected writer plans
`3b5d331029a9cda537d00789e7e7fa1d8fb5b1c7729ca19004c0443734cbad74`
and `0a2dd84be2c98e72b8ce039442e514a528a55bb4d5f9319e458816bac35e906e`
became `9dc39cf987270562859238ba423a3f17b1d3c11c1f2e049516866a853c600a84`
and `db0344991f10237119b32152a8c4ccb6bffc31f968464820a1a74e13590c7b30`.
Mapping identity `1aecbbe25b04de0d`, selected artifact identity
`01b2bed4f070d0a3fdb02e546764b3a49cb69886eebe17b4877d20294725682c`,
and materialization identity
`77dba687ceedc417c447265e33deb7a6e34d0ccaec76b1b23843203b7595d0c8`
remain unchanged.

The operator cutover proves that semantic derivation drift does not require new
physical bytes through three independent facts. First, the zero-read canonical
payload recipe for all 1,360 tensors has identity
`6c6289c096b5502eba98498bf498c80d9ca9c13ab06f5dcb62075e372274e97b`;
it covers source ranges, transformation operations, physical decisions,
lowering geometry, ordering, and encoded sizes, but is not a digest of emitted
payload bytes. Second, a complete quantization pass and an independent read of
the admitted artifact produced the same aggregate payload-byte identity
`249277b42eb1aa231bddcb33b33ae3d805f3aa5991eaa99ae091f2ea9b928eb0`.
Third, operator admission rehashes the exact 102,408,545,440-byte GGUF and
revalidates its immutable file snapshot against artifact identity
`01b2bed4f070d0a3fdb02e546764b3a49cb69886eebe17b4877d20294725682c`
before graph dispatch. The zero-read comparison separately proves names,
ranks, logical and physical dimensions, qtypes, encoded sizes, directory order,
offsets, and payload ranges; it does not claim to have read or digested payload
bytes. Together these gates report `physical_payload_compatible=1`,
`artifact_rebuild_required=0`, and `materialization_rebuild_required=0`. The
writer now owns copied provenance
strings instead of retaining stack-borrowed metadata values; its corrected
deterministic current selected-plan identity is
`db0344991f10237119b32152a8c4ccb6bffc31f968464820a1a74e13590c7b30`.
That bug fix changes planning evidence, not the unchanged serialized artifact.

The main executable exposes the production boundary through
`yvex graph attention`. The `prepare` action resolves the admitted external
artifact, constructs the current runtime descriptor and attention plan, and
publishes a content-addressed runtime binding. Execution actions independently
reopen the supplied binding, seal the immutable model and reusable session, and
invoke the production API with a full-width deterministic attention probe.
Quick scope executes one SWA, CSA, and HCA representative including real top-k
and ratio-128 state; full scope executes all 43 main layers and 634 bindings.
CPU, generated-bundle CUDA, JSON, audit, and CPU/CUDA comparison modes are
operator reachable. The independent full-equation oracle remains test-only and
is excluded from both `libyvex.a` and `yvex`. Operator CPU/CUDA admission uses
the versioned combined absolute-plus-relative schema-v2 bound, refuses
non-finite pairs, and computes RMSE over finite pairs only. Raw object bytes
matched in the admitted run, but that bitwise observation is neither required
nor presented as proof of why the numerical results agree; independent
mutation and history/top-k/ratio sensitivity tests prevent a tautological
comparison.

The content-addressed runtime binding identity is
`ba519ac9a3826ae8bb01c7ea8737c090e32a3fee8931801574615e4a66268def`;
the sealed runtime-model identity is
`3541e1739a9fa566f95b6dd8385c6a951eedcb44cdb4a5201d77f8daf59e993b`.
Semantic graph identity
`88714d9cec0b1fe7be636ab04509628839e2765484685ff0e4cb8eac9f3fd42e`
lowers to executable graph identity
`6ff61a04c828994212af68630a13346f19101f06a172ddc9a7e8948e36aa24b6`.
The admitted resident attention/envelope pack contains 806 bindings and
5,766,703,652 encoded bytes under residency identity
`3ad5d51ecbae51a66a12d913be5e3080e7695ff228757a5c8189f0268c9bac5f`.
Workspace, execution-descriptor, launch-graph, graph-exec, and benchmark
identities remain request/mode evidence and are reported by their exact
operator executions rather than being promoted to model identity.

`V010.RUNTIME.1` also performs the intentional incompatible cutover from the
former public diagnostic engine/session, flat F32 KV, fixture generation, and
generic run-report ABI. Those owners were bounded proof scaffolds tied to the
superseded runtime spine, not implementations of the retained KV, generation,
or benchmark milestones. Keeping them would create duplicate lifecycle and
capability authorities. The future milestones therefore consume the common
runtime state-provider and execution contracts directly; no compatibility
header or forwarding implementation remains.

Recovered `V010.BACKEND.0`, `.6`, `.7`, `.8`, and `.9` are promoted from
planned subtasks to completed bounded capabilities because the exact matrix,
refusal, no-bundle fallback, scratch ownership, and failure/cleanup contracts
now have consumed implementation and tests. Metal `.10` and ROCm `.11` are
reclassified as deferred future scope. `V010.BACKEND.12` remains planned until
later runtime rows lower and prove the complete architecture-required release
operation set.

Common capability milestones may use Qwen, Gemma, dense fixtures, and other
admitted inputs. They must close their typed common boundary and must not claim
another supported model.

## 7. Track Registry And Dashboard

The recovery baseline contained 629 table entries across 24 tracks. Two source
rows held paired IDs; those are expanded into 631 unique recovered IDs. The
canonical architecture now contains 26 tracks. Forty-eight new milestone/future
IDs and two explicit migration markers produce 681 unique canonical IDs.

### 7.1 Global Counts

These declarations are checked against the canonical ledger. State counts are
calculated from rows rather than protected by a summary hash.

| `TRACK.TENSOR` | Canonical tensor collections, role requirements, global/layer/attention/MoE/norm/output/tokenizer coverage, and missing-role truth. | exact DeepSeek source coverage is complete; multi-family evidence remains at its prior rank | No unresolved required tensor collection or runtime role. |
| `TRACK.RESIDENCY` | Payload streaming, materialization, placement, memory planning, CUDA residency, movement, ownership, cleanup, and release. | bounded source streaming, selected-artifact materialization, and the runtime's sealed resident DeepSeek attention-weight pack are complete; complete-model, MoE, output-head, and persistent-KV residency remain unsupported | Any admitted tensor map can materialize; admitted runtime bindings can acquire immutable backend-ready resident packs without redefining model semantics. |
| `TRACK.RUNTIME` | Runtime binding consumption, immutable runtime-model sealing, execution-session lifecycle, workload descriptors, phase/mode dispatch, reusable contexts, capability truth, invalidation, timing, and common state-provider boundaries. | the common attention execution plane is complete with DeepSeek as its first typed family adapter; persistent KV, complete transformer execution, and generation remain outside this owner | One admitted binding opens once into a reusable family-neutral runtime model whose sessions execute supported graph scopes without rebuilding compilation truth. |

| `TRACK.OPERATOR` | CLI grammar, command adaptation, typed input, dispatch, rendering, refusal, control-plane integration, topology guards, and operator acceptance. | complete DeepSeek attention is reachable through one truthful production command; prompt and release generation commands remain unsupported | Every executable milestone reaches its accepted production API through a real command or records an owned non-applicability reason. |

| `TRACK.EVAL` | Release-path correctness, regression, failure, tokenizer, context, and capability evaluation. | blocked by real generation | Repeatable evaluation passes over the release path. |
| `TRACK.BENCH` | Reproducible machine, artifact, qtype, context, prefill, decode, generation, timing, throughput, memory measurements, and evidence visualization. | bounded attention/runtime measurements and deterministic SVG evidence are implemented; full-model generation benchmark evidence is not measured | Accepted DGX Spark benchmark evidence over the release path. |
| `TRACK.RELEASE` | Validation, artifact guardrail, claim audit, operator transcript, packaging, versioning, release record, and tag. | blocked | Every release gate passes in one traceable transcript. |
| `TRACK.POST010` | Explicitly deferred portability, serving hardening, speculative execution, extra-family runtime promotion, and later product scope. | deferred | No work enters the active path without a new version-scope decision. |

### 7.2 Per-Track Counts

First-class count order is `complete / active / partial / planned / blocked /

closure.

### 7.3 Stable Track Names

The attempted compact recovery introduced replacement lanes that hid stable
ownership. The complete ledger restores the original names:

| Attempted name | Canonical disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `TRACK.ARCHITECTURE` | Use `TRACK.MODEL`; it owns family architecture IR and runtime descriptor projection. |
| `TRACK.EXECUTION` | Use `TRACK.GRAPH`; it owns graph, attention, MoE, layers, and transformer composition. |
| `TRACK.MODELS` | Removed as a future bucket. Family is a scope dimension across source/model/tensor/map/artifact/residency/runtime tracks. |
| `TRACK.PROJECT` | Project-control work remains under `TRACK.SCOPE`; `PROJECT.md` is the authority, not a parallel track. |
| `TRACK.CLAIMS` | Claim boundary remains under `TRACK.SCOPE` and release auditing under `TRACK.RELEASE`. |
| `TRACK.TOPOLOGY` | Existing topology rows remain under `TRACK.OPERATOR` until `TOPOLOGY.CELL.CLOSURE.0` proves a justified split. |

`TRACK.COMPILATION` is an intentional post-recovery addition. It owns immutable
plans and identities between logical mapping and physical lowering; it is not a
replacement name for `TRACK.MODEL`, `TRACK.MAP`, `TRACK.QUANT`, or
`TRACK.ARTIFACT`.

`TRACK.RUNTIME` is an explicit ownership extraction from `TRACK.GENERATION`.
It owns one common model/session execution lifecycle; family adapters provide
typed semantics, while generation retains autoregressive composition. It does
not create a DeepSeek-specific runtime spine or duplicate any canonical ID.

## 9. Complete Track/Wave Ledger

This is the canonical expansion of every track. Every ID appears exactly once
in this section. First-class milestones are separated from recovered subordinate
rows. "Consumer" names the conclusive milestone or future decision that owns
the row's use.

### 9.1 TRACK.SCOPE

**Owner:** Project control, release scope, family/release distinction, claim boundary, version policy, repository semantic ownership, C interface/build boundaries, architecture-control transitions, and public-document transitions.

**Current truth:** repository-wide semantic compression and C canonicalization are complete; the common runtime model/session and attention execution plane are admitted, and persistent KV is the single active milestone

**Ledger summary:** 25 recovered IDs; 8 first-class milestones; 7 complete support rows; 12 open support rows; 6 superseded/deferred rows.

### 9.10 TRACK.RESIDENCY

**Owner:** Payload streaming, materialization, placement, memory planning, CUDA residency, movement, ownership, cleanup, and release.

**Current truth:** common source-side streaming and family-neutral materialization are complete; the common runtime now seals one resident DeepSeek attention-weight pack with stable host/device ownership, while complete-model, MoE, output-head, and persistent-KV residency remain unsupported

**Ledger summary:** 42 recovered IDs; 2 first-class milestones; 27 complete support rows; 14 open support rows; 0 superseded/deferred rows.

#### Recovered And Subordinate Rows

At payload closure, `V010.STORAGE.0` through `.16` and `.18` through `.20`
are explicitly reclassified from planned subtasks to completed capability or
evidence rows because their outcomes are now implemented, consumed, and
tested. Their IDs, `TRACK.RESIDENCY` ownership, and
`V010.SOURCE.PAYLOAD.STREAM.0` consumer remain stable; they are not new
milestones. `V010.STORAGE.17` remains planned because no concrete GLM source
target or payload snapshot exists.

### 9.11 TRACK.RUNTIME

**Owner:** Runtime binding consumption, immutable runtime-model sealing, mutable execution-session lifecycle, execution descriptors, phase/mode dispatch, reusable contexts, capability truth, invalidation, timing, and common state-provider boundaries.

**Current truth:** one family-neutral sealed runtime model/session plane consumes a content-addressed binding and resident attention resources without rebuilding compilation truth; DeepSeek is the first typed adapter, CPU eager and GB10 CUDA eager/piecewise/full attention execution are admitted, and persistent KV, complete transformer execution, and generation remain unsupported

**Ledger summary:** 18 recovered IDs; 1 first-class milestone; 9 complete support rows; 8 open support rows; 0 superseded/deferred rows.

`V010.RUNTIME.0` through `V010.RUNTIME.17` move here explicitly from
`TRACK.GENERATION`; their IDs remain stable. `V010.RUNTIME.1` is promoted from
a planned subtask to the completed common runtime milestone.
`V010.RUNTIME.3`, `.6`, `.7`, and `.8` are reclassified from planned subtasks
to completed evidence because their state-mutation, phase-failure, preflight,
and graph-failure contracts now have executable consumers. All other retained
ranks and states remain unchanged. No row is duplicated and no family-specific
runtime spine is introduced.

#### First-Class Milestones

| Milestone | Scope | State | Conclusive after-state | Depends on | Origin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `V010.RUNTIME.1` | common | `complete` | Sealed one immutable family-neutral runtime model and process-lifetime execution-session plane over a content-addressed binding, resident attention resources, phase-aware execution descriptors, CPU eager and GB10 CUDA eager/graph modes, invalidation, timing, and bounded benchmark/profile and external-chart capability. | V010.CLI.GRAPH.0 | recovered/promoted |

### 9.12 TRACK.BACKEND

**Owner:** Hardware/build profiles, CPU/CUDA capability, qtype operations, reference parity, scratch, fallback, synchronization, refusal, and cleanup.

**Current truth:** CUDA capability admission is fail-closed; the common runtime consumes resident DeepSeek attention through admitted eager, piecewise CUDA Graph, and full CUDA Graph modes with no CPU numerical fallback, while complete-transformer backend support remains undefined

**Ledger summary:** 29 recovered IDs; 1 first-class milestones; 11 complete support rows; 16 open support rows; 2 superseded/deferred rows.

## 10. Evidence Lanes

Current diagnostic, report, fixture, selected, CLI, topology, and audit work
stays visible because it contains real implementation and prevents repeated
work. Historical rows remain visible only as decommission provenance; they do
not imply that the retired code or ABI is still executable. Evidence rank
limits the claim either class may support.

| Evidence lane | Valid use | Non-claim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source/model reports | Inspect facts, exercise typed boundaries, test refusal, and seed complete architecture/map work | reports alone do not verify source payloads, mapping, artifacts, or runtime support |
| Source payload fixtures/live proof | Exercise digest authority, manifest publication, indexed ranges, exact bounded reads, budgets, cancellation, drift, transactional delivery, and complete DeepSeek mapping handoff | not conversion, quantization, artifact emission, materialization, runtime residency, or generation |
| Transformation IR fixtures/live plan | Exercise immutable DAG construction, operation/shape/dtype refusal, canonical identity, large fan-in, allocation rollback, exhaustive payload-range binding, and GGUF lowering equivalence | not byte transformation, precision selection, quantization, artifact emission, materialization, runtime execution, or generation |
| Quantization codecs/live execution | Exercise the fixed profile, canonical codecs and refusal matrix, four current IR operations, trusted bounded reads, transactional digest output, role/qtype numeric metrics, allocation and sink faults, and direct CPU/CUDA qtype compute | not GGUF emission, artifact admission, materialization, residency, transformer execution, generation, or arbitrary-family quantization support |
| Complete GGUF emission/roundtrip | Exercise immutable writer planning, exact tokenizer metadata, transactional terminal delivery, atomic publication, physical SHA-256 identity, native full-byte verification, pinned official-reader parsing, deterministic reserialization, and complete-artifact admission | not materialization, residency, runtime binding, transformer execution, generation, evaluation, benchmark, or a supported model artifact |
| GGUF fixtures/tensor proofs | Parser, geometry, range, writer-fragment, materialization, and primitive regression | not a complete or supported model artifact |
| Primitive/selected graph proofs | One operation, transfer, cleanup, tolerance, or bounded composition | not full attention, transformer execution, or generation |
| Common runtime attention plane | Exercise immutable runtime-binding admission, one process-lifetime model/session, resident attention weights, phase/mode dispatch, eager/CUDA Graph execution, state deltas, invalidation, cold/warm timing, baseline comparison, and deterministic external charts | not persistent KV, tokenizer-backed prefill, complete transformer execution, generation, evaluation, or full-model benchmark proof |
| Historical diagnostic runtime/generation state | Decommissioned lifecycle, refusal, cancellation, flat F32 KV, fixture logits/sampling, bounded token-loop, and cleanup evidence removed by the `V010.RUNTIME.1` cutover | historical provenance only; not current executable evidence and not model-backed prefill, KV, decode, logits, sampling, or generation |
| Operator/topology evidence | Discoverability, ownership enforcement, refusal propagation, and transcript regression | cannot create a lower domain capability |
| Internal fixtures | Deterministic vectors, corrupt files, synthetic tokens/logits, and allocation failures | not model quality, benchmark, or release proof |

Evidence may be removed only when the behavior itself is intentionally removed
and the owning milestone records the decision. Demotion from first-class status
is not authorization to delete code, tests, or family work.

### 10.1 Decommission Obligations

These are project-owned cutover obligations for retained and already
decommissioned residue. Availability is row-specific and is never presumed.
An undecommissioned surface remains at its current evidence rank only until
its consuming milestone removes, replaces, retains, or absorbs it and passes
the stated acceptance boundary. `V010.RUNTIME.1` is the completed cutover
consumer for the former diagnostic engine/session, flat F32 KV, fixture
generation, and generic run-report surface; those superseded owners and their
installed headers were intentionally removed rather than left available.

| Surface | Code-grounded locations | Required disposition | Consuming milestone and acceptance boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selected embedding and segment commands | Remaining compatibility parsing/rendering is confined to `src/cli/input/graph.c`, `src/cli/render/graph.c`, `src/runtime/graph.c`, and `tests/cli/attention_graph.sh`; standalone partial/segment scripts are removed. | Absorb valid backend/reference comparisons into internal proofs; remove any surviving selected product aliases. | `V010.GRAPH.DEEPSEEK.TRANSFORMER.0`: full transformer tests own public graph proof and selected command discovery is gone. |
| Persistent KV | Diagnostic prefill/report/CLI and flat F32 KV precursors are removed; no family-correct persistent KV owner is admitted. | Implement family-correct persistent attention-backed KV ownership. | `V010.RUNTIME.DEEPSEEK.KV.0`, then `V010.RUNTIME.DEEPSEEK.PREFILL.0`: prefill writes model K/V and decode reads the same owned state. |
| Diagnostic decode | The former summary-only command, production owner, and CLI tests are removed. | Implement model-backed decode directly over the common runtime and persistent KV boundary. | `V010.RUNTIME.DEEPSEEK.DECODE.0`: decode consumes the executable descriptor and attention-backed KV. |
| Fixture logits and sampling | Former production fixture owners and public CLI surfaces are removed. | Introduce only final-norm/output-head logits and sampling over the real vocabulary when their milestones activate. | `V010.RUNTIME.DEEPSEEK.LOGITS.0`, `V010.RUNTIME.SAMPLING.0`: sampled IDs derive from full-vocabulary model logits. |
| Bounded diagnostic generation | Former diagnostic production/CLI owners and token-printing tests are removed; catalog schemas remain inert retained compatibility data until the generation milestone owns their disposition. | Implement only the tokenizer/prefill/KV/decode/logits/sample/append/stop chain. | `V010.RUNTIME.DEEPSEEK.GENERATION.0`: multiple detokenized autoregressive tokens pass release-path tests. |
| Selected-artifact support levels | `include/yvex/model.h`, `src/model/artifacts/gate.c`, registry/report owners, prepare renderers, model gate/registry tests | Complete-artifact admission now consumes one canonical typed result; retained bounded subsets remain tensor proof artifacts and cannot enter that path. | `V010.ARTIFACT.SUPPORT.CUTOVER.0`: complete; runtime support still requires materialization and every higher gate. |
| Report-only fullmodel surfaces | `src/cli/model_artifacts/fullmodel.c` and `tests/cli/fullmodel.sh` | Replace useful descriptor/materialization facts with typed full-target APIs; remove reports that only restate missing runtime behavior. | `V010.RUNTIME.DESCRIPTOR.DEEPSEEK.0`: one typed executable descriptor boundary remains and obsolete report commands are gone. |
| Stale target, help, and claim tests | `src/model/target/{catalog,decision,candidates}.c`, `src/cli/main.c`, generation examples/help, `tests/cli/core.sh`, and `tests/cli/models.sh` | Remove multi-family/selected release choices and stale examples; first expose exact full-target refusal, then the real generation command. | `V010.REBASE.DEEPSEEK.0` owns target truth; `V010.CLI.DEEPSEEK.GENERATE.0` owns final command/help proof. |

| Release | Full validation, artifact guardrail, claim audit, transcript, packaging, version, and tag | blocked | `V010.RELEASE.0` |

A gate changes state only through its owning milestone and executable proof.
Documentation can correct claims and dependency control; it cannot promote an
artifact, runtime, generation, evaluation, benchmark, or release capability.

## 12. Reference Architecture Ownership

`docs/reference-architecture.md` is the sole owner of the
implementation-agnostic inference architecture, its terminology, planes,
identity and lifecycle decomposition, conformance invariants, and the external
paper/specification/implementation map. Its traceability appendix connects
primary vLLM, SGLang, GGUF/ggml/llama.cpp, MLC LLM, IREE/MLIR,
TensorRT-LLM/CUTLASS, ExecuTorch, DwarfStar, and DeepSeek sources to concrete
YVEX owners and milestones. The reference architecture informs design and
independent comparison; it does not confer API compatibility, runtime topology,
backend support, model support, compilation correctness, or benchmark
evidence, and it does not own current project state.

## 13. Explicit Non-Claims

YVEX does not currently claim:

- a supported DeepSeek-V4-Flash target;
- a supported DeepSeek-V4-Flash model artifact; the admitted artifacts are consumed by attention but have not passed the complete runtime and release gates;
- quantization beyond the fixed DeepSeek profile and four currently admitted Transformation IR operations;
- automatic optimization, incremental compilation, multi-variant generation, or Pareto selection;
- an artifact materialization cache or inference-time SSD expert streaming;
- complete-model, MoE, output-head, or persistent-KV residency; only the admitted attention weight pack is resident;
- an execution-complete DeepSeek transformer runtime; the common attention runtime is admitted but persistent KV, FFN/MoE, complete layer composition, and final model output are not;
- complete transformer execution;
- persistent attention-backed KV, tokenizer-backed full-model prompt prefill,
  or model decode;
- output-head vocabulary logits or model-backed sampling;
- exact tokenizer-backed autoregressive DeepSeek text generation;
- CUDA model generation;
- evaluation readiness, full-model/generation benchmark evidence, or release readiness; bounded attention runtime measurements and charts do not close those gates;
- Qwen, Gemma, GLM, or another model as a supported generation target;
- Metal, ROCm, server, distributed, or speculative support.

Qwen/Gemma profiles, mappings, inventories, proof artifacts, primitive
comparisons, CLI grammar, reports, fixtures, and external runner output remain
real project evidence at their named stage. They are neither deleted nor
promoted into unsupported claims.

## 14. Version Sequence

| Version | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| v0.1.0 | DeepSeek-V4-Flash text generation from a complete YVEX-produced GGUF on DGX Spark CUDA |
| v0.1.x | Correctness, reliability, extra qtypes, streaming, performance, and memory hardening of the same path |
| v0.2.0 | Qwen dense full generation over the same family-aware common engine, subject to explicit complete gates |
| v0.3.0 | Gemma full generation, subject to explicit complete gates |
| v0.4.0 | Multi-family/multi-qtype matrix and backend portability after explicit scope decisions |

The version sequence records intended dependency order, not current support.

## 15. Documentation Ownership And Cutover

| `docs/api.md` | Public C API facts and lifetime boundaries |
| `MODEL_ARTIFACTS.md` | Artifact terminology, admission, integrity, writer/reader, materialization, and support contract |

## 16. Agent Start Checklist

Before proposing or implementing a delivery:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT.md`, the owning contract, implementation,
   direct consumers, and focused tests.
2. Confirm the single Active Next and its predecessors.
3. Confirm the row is rank `milestone`; never schedule a subordinate row as a
   standalone delivery.
4. Inspect existing types, registries, APIs, fixtures, and guards before
   proposing files or symbols.
5. State exact before/after capability, owner, consumer, family scope, failure
   behavior, proof stage, and higher-stage non-claims.
6. Reuse common infrastructure; do not hard-code DeepSeek behavior into
   family-neutral artifact, materialization, descriptor, or backend owners.
7. Preserve Qwen, Gemma, dense/common, fixture, diagnostic, and topology work at
   its truthful rank.
8. Run focused tests and complete repository validation.
9. Classify `cli_applicability` for every milestone. Executable capability is
   incomplete until the main `yvex` binary invokes its production API directly;
   non-executable work records an owned non-applicability reason.
10. Update this map atomically with implementation result and next dependency.

The complete current ledger remains in this file. Future refinement may improve
rank, descriptions, or milestone grouping, but it must preserve every ID or
record an explicit migration.
